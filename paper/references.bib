  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}While culture is widespread in the animal kingdom, human culture has been claimed to be special due to being cumulative. It is currently debated which cognitive abilities support cumulative culture, but behavior copying is one of the main abilities proposed. One important source of contention is the presence or absence of behavior copying in our closest living relatives, non-human great apes (apes) -- especially given that their behavior does not show clear signs of cumulation. Those who claim that apes copy behavior often base this claim on the existence of stable ape cultures in the wild (Whiten et al. 1999; van Schaik et al. 2003). We developed an individual-based model to test whether ape cultural patterns can both emerge and stabilize in the entire absence of any behavior copying, but only allowing for a well-supported alternative social learning mechanism, namely socially-mediated reinnovation, where only the frequency of reinnovation is under social influence, but the form of the behavior is not. Our model reflects wild ape life conditions, including physiological and behavioral individual needs, demographic and spatial features, and the possible range of genetic and ecological variations between populations. Our results show that, under a wide range of realistic values of all model parameters, we fully reproduce the most defining features of wild ape cultural patterns (Whiten et al. 1999; van Schaik et al. 2003). Overall, our results show that ape cultures can both emerge and stabilize without behavior copying. Ape cultures are therefore unable to pinpoint behavior copying abilities, lending support to the notion that behavior copying is, among apes, unique in the human lineage.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  author = {Addison, David J},
  pages = {13},
  abstract = {This paper reviews the evidence for large-scale basalt tool manufacturing on Tutuila and the geographical and temporal spread of those tools in the southwest Pacific. Since the first anthropological work in Samoa in the 1920s, Tutuila has been known as a center of basalt tool manufacture. The last decade has seen a doubling of the number of documented lithic manufacture and quarry sites (50), with several now securely dated to \textasciitilde 700-600 cal BP. A later period of 500-300 cal BP may also be indicated. Regional distribution is greatest in the earlier period, but some evidence suggests movement of Tutuila basalt tools in the later period, at least to nearby archipelagoes. Tutuila adzes are documented over a 5600 km distribution from Pohnpei in the northwest to Ma'uke in the southeast. Tutuila has been long recognized as a major production and distribution center for high-quality basalt1 tools in the southwest Pacific (e.g., Best et al. 1992, Clark 2002, Clark 1993, Clark et al. 1997, Di Piazza and Pearthree 2001, Leach and Witter 1990, Weisler and Kirch 1996, Winterhoff 2003). This has elsewhere been termed the Tutuila Basalt Export Industry (Addison and Asaua 2006). This paper first reviews the evidence for tool production on Tutuila, then examines where Tutuila products have been found.},

We also document microscopic traces (use-wear, resin, ochre, starch granules and apparent blood films) on glass, stone and ceramic points from museum collections and excavated artefacts.

  abstract = {An apparent colonisation of the Papuan south coast by pottery-making villagers about 2000 years ago led in the 1970s to the development of a regional sequence of first millennium AD decorated pottery styles now known as Early Papuan pottery (EPP). Important in defining this style horizon is the Yule Island site of Oposisi first excavated by Ron Vanderwal in 1969. As part of an on-going re-appraisal of pottery production along this coast by two of us (see Summerhayes and Allen 2007) we took advantage of an opportunity to re-sample the site in 2007. A paper proposing a much earlier starting date for EPP based on dates for sherds in Torres Strait (McNiven et al. 2006) meant that we could also take advantage of this visit to acquire further dating samples. A coherent set of seven new AMS dates strongly supports the Oposisi sequence beginning at c.\,2000\,BP. Beyond this our sample produced much more obsidian, imported from Fergusson Island 600 km to the east, than had previously been recorded for the site. This attests to stronger and more continuous eastern links than had been previously supposed. Lastly the paper reviews EPP in the light of recent pottery finds that suggest pre-EPP pottery will occur on the south Papuan coast.},

  abstract = {Pairwise similarity coefficients are downward biased when samples only record presences and sampling is partial. A simple but forgotten index proposed by Stephen Forbes in 1907 can help solve this problem. His original equation requires knowing the number of species absent in both samples that could have been present. It is proposed that this count should simply be ignored and that the coefficient should be adjusted using a simple heuristic correction. Four analyses show that the corrected equation outperforms the Dice and Simpson indices, which are highly correlated with many others. In two-sample simulations, similarity is almost always closer to the assumed value when the species pool size and sampling intensity are varied, regardless of whether the underlying abundance distribution is uniform, lognormal, or geometric. The index is also much more robust when sampling is unequal. An analysis of bat samples from peninsular Malaysia buttresses these conclusions. The corrected coefficient also indicates that local assemblages of North American mammals are random subsamples of larger species pools by returning similarity of values of around 1, and it suggests a more consistent relationship between biome-scale comparisons and local-scale comparisons. Finally, it yields a better-dispersed pattern when the biome-scale inventories are ordinated. If these results are generalizable, then the new and old equation should see wide application, potentially taking the place of the two most commonly used alternatives (the interrelated Dice and Jaccard indices) whenever sampling is incomplete.},

  abstract = {The transition from mobile to sedentary life was one of the greatest social challenges of the human past. Yet little is known about the impact of this fundamental change on social interactions amongst early Neolithic communities, which are best recorded in the Near East. The importance of social processes associated with these economic and ecological changes has long been underestimated. However, ethnographic observations demonstrate that generalized reciprocity \textendash{} such as open access to resources and land \textendash{} had to be reduced to a circumscribed group before regular farming and herding could be successfully established. Our aim was thus to investigate the role of familial relationships as one possible factor within this process of segregation as recorded directly in the skeletal remains, rather than based on hypothetical correlations such as house types and social units. Here we present the revealing results of the systematically recorded epigenetic characteristics of teeth and skulls of the late Pre-Pottery Neolithic community of Basta in Southern Jordan (Figure S1). Additionally, mobility was reconstructed via a systematic strontium (Sr) isotope analysis of tooth enamel of the Basta individuals. The frequency of congenitally missing maxillary lateral incisors in the 9,000-year-old community of Basta is exceptionally high (35.7\%). Genetic studies and a worldwide comparison of the general rate of this dental anomaly in modern and historic populations show that the enhanced frequency can only be explained by close familial relationships akin to endogamy. This is supported by strontium isotope analyses of teeth, indicating a local origin of almost all investigated individuals. Yet, the accompanying archaeological finds document far-reaching economic exchange with neighboring groups and a population density hitherto unparalleled. We thus conclude that endogamy in the early Neolithic village of Basta was not due to geographic isolation or a lack of exogamous mating partners but a socio-cultural choice.},

Health literacy, which includes the individual knowledge about Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs), is a factor with influence in safe behaviors regarding own sexual living and It assessment is often neglected in services for adults with Cerebral Palsy (CP). The purpose of this study was to develop a simple, easily administered scale to assess the knowledge about STDs for adults with CP, in Portugal. Forty-two participants (28 men, 14 women), aged 18\textendash 53 years, with CP were interviewed with a structured questionnaire about sexuality knowledge, where questions about STDs were used as basis for Guttman scale development. From the eighteen items of the questionnaire, 10 were considered as related to STD and a valid Guttman scale containing 8 items was derived (CR = 0.92, MMR = 0.80, CS = 0.61). The median score of the summed items from the developed scale was 6 (IQ1\textendash IQ3 = 5.0\textendash 8.0) and the range of correct answers was between 3 and 8. The proportion of correct answers to each question ranged between 97.6 and 47.6 \%. The results of this study suggest that it is possible to combine questions that represent diverse aspects of STDs knowledge in an ordered scale and be used in an assessment, including self-administered tools, of adults of CP. This measure is time effective and can be used in with advantages both for health professionals and persons with CP.},

Despite the reduced corpus available, it was possible to establish the existence of Mousterian settlements throughout the Cantabrian region at the end of the Middle Pleistocene, particularly during interstadial MIS 5e and MIS 6. Whereas the evidence for the Lower Palaeolithic is limited to a few sites such as Louselas, Cabo Busto or Irikaitz, which contain characteristic Acheulean tools, the Cantabrian coast was densely populated by Neanderthal settlements during the MIS 5e Climatic Optimum. This settlement pattern seems to include open air sites, together with uninterrupted habitat in caves from MIS 6 to the end of the Mousterian period in the region.},

  abstract = {Radiocarbon dating results from the Batanes archaeological project (2002\textendash 2004) are analysed and compared with similar data from northern Luzon. It is argued that the reef-shell and pottery residue ages are not as reliable as dates on charcoal, and that the latter show a relatively late colonization of the Batanes, beginning about 800 BC on charcoal ages. The two successive early phases originally proposed, Sunget and Naidi, are amalgamated into a single early period. As early neolithic sites in northern Luzon are significantly older, beginning about 1700 BC on charcoal dates, early neolithic movement from Taiwan might have bypassed the Batanes. Early Batanes material culture exhibits similarities with types and assemblages in both Taiwan and northern Luzon, and linguistic data cannot determine whether the conservative Batanic languages reflect colonisation earlier than settlement of Luzon, or isolation in the Batanes. Consideration of the geography of island Southeast Asia and of the general pattern of late Holocene island colonization does not offer support to simple steppingstone models of neolithic dispersal. At least two phases of dispersal, one earlier from the southwest, and one later from the northeast, can be hypothesized. Their potential existence raises questions about the nature and interaction of late Holocene populations in the region, suggesting that neolithic cultural inventories may have been more partitioned, and relations more reticulate, than is sometimes envisaged. As expansion of farming is relatively poorly documented, its common demographic impact probably does not account for rapid neolithic expansion. The evolution of maritime technology and climatic change, especially around 2000 BC, suggest alternative avenues for further investigation of late Holocene movements in island Southeast Asia.},

  abstract = {Our goal is to study the role of demographic change in the development and spread of maritime adaptations in the North American Arctic over the last 6000 years. We compile and analyze a regional radiocarbon database (n = 935) for northern Alaska, using Oxcal to analyze demographic patterns in summed probability distributions. We find that northern Alaskan populations grew significantly over the last 4500 years, although growth was punctuated by three periods of decline from approximately 3700 to 3125 cal BP, 1000 cal BP, and 600 cal BP. We assess possible alternative explanations for the observed demographic patterns (e.g. calibration and taphonomic effects, investigator bias). Region-wide erosion and calibration effects likely contribute to the dearth of radiocarbon dates around 1000 cal BP, and sampling bias may contribute to the post-600 cal BP decline. However, we conclude that the overall pattern reflects regional population growth, decline, and recovery. Population growth predates intensification of marine resource procurement by at least 1200 years; we hypothesize that population growth was a possible driver for late Holocene marine intensification in the Arctic. These findings have further implications for understanding the process of intensification and the development of complexity in coastal hunter-gatherer societies.},

However, the stratigraphy for much of the excavated area is sketchy and no precise chronology of settlement is available. Renewed excavations in the Fa`ahia site area in 2007, although relatively limited in scope, produced more stratigraphic detail, additional faunal remains and artefacts, including a patu, and 12 new radiocarbon dates on short lifespan material from the lowest cultural layer which indicate initial human occupation about AD\,1050\textendash 1160. In the light of this result, recent arguments for earlier initial colonisation of Central East Polynesia are reviewed. Chronological evidence adduced in these relies primarily upon radiocarbon samples with potentially substantial inbuilt age, and it is concluded that there is no empirical case for colonization of the region prior to the early eleventh century AD.},

Measuring reduction is therefore a vital component of understanding past technology and behavior in Australia, and requires that we develop effective procedures for quantifying reduction for all classes of materials. In this paper, a range of reduction measures are presented for cores, flakes, and different kinds of retouched flakes. These are used to determine the extent to which varying levels of reduction intensity have shaped assemblage composition through time. Changing artefact reduction is tied to systems of land use and provisioning over the past 15,000 years by examining fluctuating occupational intensities, raw material movement, scavenging and recycling of artefacts, and technological diversity. Changes in all of these dimensions of past behavior are linked to Holocene climatic fluctuations and the onset of intensified El Nin\texttildelow o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events in the past 3,500 years.},

  abstract = {The thickness and weight of a bulletproof glass material can be reduced by using strengthened glass that possesses current protective capabilities. In this study, numerical simulations are performed to estimate the protective capability of strengthened borosilicate glass used in bulletproof glass systems. High-velocity impacts and perforation behavior are well described by a dynamic brittle fracture model. A parametric study of the material model of glass is conducted by comparing test results of individual impacts with corresponding numerical estimations; the size of back-surface spall, morphology of perforated surface, and fractured areas are compared. Material parameters of strengthened and non-strengthened borosilicate glasses are determined. Numerical simulations that use a material model considering these parameters well describe the overall fracture behavior of bulletproof glass. The main parameters that affect protective capability are initial compressive yield and fracture stresses. The protective capability of strengthened borosilicate glass is \textasciitilde 20\% better than that of non-strengthened borosilicate glass.},

  abstract = {We present the findings of excavations at the stratified site of Ushbulak, discovered during a joint Russian-Kazakhstan research project in 2016. The site is located in the Shilikty Valley, northeastern Kazakhstan, at the junction of routes connecting southwestern Central Asia, southern Siberia, and northern China. On the basis of stratigraphy, chronology, and technological evidence, we identify three technological complexes, relating to the Metal Ages (stratum 1), Final Upper Paleolithic (strata 2\textendash 4), and Initial Upper Paleolithic (strata 5.2\textendash 7). Focusing on the principal markers of the Initial Upper Paleolithic in the region, we conclude that finds from strata 5.2\textendash 7 belong to the southern SiberianMongolian variant of the Initial Upper Paleolithic, as evidenced by the uni- and bidirectional parallel volumetric blade core reduction, tool types, and absolute chronology. The tool kit includes mostly endscrapers, heavily retouched blades, and truncated-facetted or notched implements. Particularly diagnostic types include waisted blade, blade with a ventrally retouched distal edge, beveled point, backed blade, stemmed implement with a sharp tip, stemmed endscraper, and burin-core. Two AMS-dates from stratum 6 date this layer to ca 36,180 {$\pm$} 730 and 41,110 {$\pm$} 302 BP. The closest known parallels to the industry of the lower strata of Ushbulak are finds from horizon UP2 of Kara-Bom in the Russian Altai. Our results suggest that Ushbulak strata 5.2\textendash 7 correlate with the Initial Upper Paleolithic industries of the Altai (Denisova Cave), northern China (Luotoshi), and Mongolia (Tolbor-4 and -21).},

However, recent analyses of fossil, archaeological, and environmental data indicate that such traits did not arise as a single package. Instead, some arose substantially earlier and some later than previously thought. From \textasciitilde 2.5 to 1.5 million years ago, three lineages of early
              Homo
              evolved in a context of habitat instability and fragmentation on seasonal, intergenerational, and evolutionary time scales. These contexts gave a selective advantage to traits, such as dietary flexibility and larger body size, that facilitated survival in shifting environments.},

We propose that they had a wide range of meanings for their users and functioned in both utilitarian and ceremonial contexts, similar to more recent ground stone axes from Highland New Guinea. They therefore represent the earliest evidence for valuables in Papua New Guinea. Here we draw together studies of the technology, spatial distribution, and chemical sourcing of the artefacts, along with considerations of fragility and brightness, to evaluate competing models for their function as utilitarian items and as exchange goods. Whereas many artefacts were probably useful tools integrated within a mobile settlement pattern, others were clearly reserved for special functions, and many may have operated in both the utilitarian and ceremonial spheres.

            Auff\"allige Obsidianartefakte aus West-Neubritannien treten von 3950 cal BC auf und verschwinden pl\"otzlich um 1650 cal BC. Wir sind der Auffassung, dass sie ein breites Spektrum von Bedeutungen f\"ur ihre Nutzer hatten und ihre Rolle sowohl in funktionalem als auch zeremoniellem Kontext spielten, \"ahnlich j\"ungeren geschliffenen Stein\"axten aus dem Hochland Neu Guineas. Deshalb stellen sie den fr\"uhesten Nachweis f\"ur Wertgegenst\"ande in Papua Neu Guinea dar. Wir werten hier Studien zur Technologie, r\"aumlichen Verteilung und chemischen Zusammensetzung aus, zusammen mit \"Uberlegungen zu Fragilit\"at und Aussehen, um verschiedene Modelle zu ihrer Funktion als Gebrauchsgegenst\"ande wie auch als Austauschg\"uter zu bewerten. Waren viele Artefakte sicherlich n\"utzliche Werkzeuge innerhalb einer mobilen Siedlungsweise, wurden andere offensichtlich f\"ur einen speziellen Gebrauch reserviert, und viele m\"ogen sowohl in funktionalen als auch in zeremoniellen Sph\"aren in Aktion getreten sein.},

  abstract = {Archaeologists have emphasized men's activities and neglected the role of women in their analyses of lithic assemblages. In this study, I argue that both men and women created lithic debitage and used stone tools. I further argue that women created and used stone tools primarily in the context of activities conducted at residential sites; in contrast, men created and used tools away from the residential site. I build expectations for my analyses by examining ethnographic data. I use these expectations to examine lithic assemblages produced between A.D. 1050 and 1300 in the central Mesa Verde region. Women's use of lithics includes tools used in maize grinding, including the use of peckingstones to refurbish manos and metates. In contrast, men's activities included the production of projectile points; I demonstrate that this mostly occurred outside the village. I use these insights to examine Rosaldo's (1974) proposition that social and economic power is tied to gender and whether one's role includes access to public contexts or is restricted to domestic contexts. I conclude that that was not the case in the central Mesa Verde region where gender roles appear to have been complementary.},

They have been partially charred, possibly to lessen the labor of scraping boxwood, using a technique so far not documented at the time. The wooden artifacts have the size and features of multipurpose tools known as ``digging sticks,'' which are quite commonly used by foragers. This discovery from Poggetti Vecchi provides evidence of the processing and use of wood by early Neanderthals, showing their ability to use fire in tool making from very tough wood.},

  abstract = {This study applies a new three-dimensional measurement technique to determine the major source of variation in the Acheulian bifacial tool collection from the Middle Pleistocene site of Elandsfontein, South Africa. This three-dimensional technique is compared with conventional two-dimensional methods to investigate which methods capture morphological variation in the assemblage most comprehensively. Additionally, a set of experimentally produced bifacial tools are incorporated into the analyses to isolate the behavioral pattern underpinning identified variation in the archaeological assemblage. The interpretative breadth of current models explaining morphological variation in bifacial tools is then tested against the pattern identified in the Elandsfontein assemblage. Variation appears to be related to the consistent application of a specific reduction strategy associated with the early stages of bifacial tool manufacture. The intensity with which this strategy was applied seems to have been mediated by the availability of raw material that was suitable for the production of large bifacial tools.},

The timing of its appearance is of considerable scholarly interest because of its significant role in the evolution of sociopolitical complexity among the coastal Chumash, who were among the world's most complex hunter-gatherers. This paper closely considers: (a) what constitutes reliable empirical evidence for canoe making and maintenance; (b) the most current estimate for the date of origin of this sophisticated watercraft (and the empirical foundations for such an estimate); (c) a scenario for the development of the tomol as a complex technological system (CTS) and why credit is appropriately assigned to the coastal Chumash for its development; and (d) the impacts of this technological system on Chumash sociopolitical evolution.

I explore technological features and performance characteristics of a major lithic raw material type, fused shale, used by Chumash and Tongva toolmakers of southern California for making spear and arrow points. The primary source for this material was the Grimes Canyon vicinity, 35 km inland from Ventura, California. Fused shale was one of several cryptocrystalline materials favored regionally for making projectile points, along with various cherts from the Monterey and Franciscan formations and, more rarely, non-local obsidians. I discuss physical characteristics of fused shale, the chronological and spatial distribution of fused shale artifacts, the propensity of fused shale points to fracture, and results of a preliminary portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) trace elemental analysis on source material from the Grimes Canyon quarry as well as archaeological specimens from Middle through Historic period components at northern Channel Islands sites.},

Differences are observed between the two localities. At the Acheulean site of EF-HR, percussive tools were predominantly used in the production of flakes and large cutting tools (LCTs). At the Oldowan site of HWK EE, the tool repertoire probably related to a wider range of activities, including bone breaking and bipolar knapping. Comparison of these two assemblages, potentially produced by different hominin species, helps provide a wider picture of pounding activities during the Oldowan-Acheulean transition at Olduvai Gorge.},

Peak populations are suggested for Marine Isotope Stages (MISs) 13 and 11, and population decline is indicated after MIS 10. This data is compared to the individual site records for the early Middle Palaeolithic, where a similar pattern of decline in the number of sites is discernible. Differences between the British and mainland northwest European records may be explained by the changing palaeogeography of Britain. In particular, the progressive subsidence of the floor of the North Sea Basin made recolonisation of Britain during warm events increasingly difficult. Finally, models are put forward for interpreting population change in relation to the climatic record, the subsidence of the North Sea Basin and the changing ability of humans to withstand cold conditions.},

The interglacial sediments and the later temperate phase are separated by the so-called `Arctic Bed' from which cold-climate macroscopic plant and beetle remains have been recovered. The later temperate phase was deposited during an episode of boreal woodland and is associated with the artefacts, a diverse vertebrate fauna and molluscs. New amino acid geochronological data and biostratigraphical considerations suggest that the post-Hoxnian sequence correlates with late substages of MIS 11.

The later temperate phase was deposited during an episode of boreal woodland and is associated with the artefacts, a diverse vertebrate fauna and molluscs. New amino acid geochronological data and biostratigraphical considerations suggest that the post-Hoxnian sequence correlates with late substages of MIS 11. The paper further investigates the correlation of the sequence at Hoxne with the palynological sequences found elsewhere in Europe and adjacent offshore areas.},

Some inferences are drawn and suggestions are made concerning the potential contribution of archaeobotanical research to questions of broader archaeological significance about socio-economic change in the southern Levant during the Pre-pottery Neolithic.},

It is argued that these concepts are too abstractly defined to enable meaningful insights into the dynamics of Early Neolithic societies. A different theoretical framework is needed in order to achieve an historical understanding of the spatial and temporal variability of regional socio-cultural interactions and population displacement. This framework begins with the detailed analysis of local patterns of social organization and exchange. Exchange itself is seen as a socially situated process that was integrally related to the negotiation and reproduction of collective identities during the Neolithic.},

  abstract = {Precise identification of the time when a process has changed enables process engineers to search for a potential special cause more effectively. In this paper, we develop change point estimation methods for a Poisson process in a Bayesian framework. We apply Bayesian hierarchical models to formulate the change point where there exists a step change, a linear trend and a known multiple number of changes in the Poisson rate. The Markov chain Monte Carlo is used to obtain posterior distributions of the change point parameters and corresponding probabilistic intervals and inferences. The performance of the Bayesian estimator is investigated through simulations and the result shows that precise estimates can be obtained when they are used in conjunction with the well-known c-, Poisson exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) and Poisson cumulative sum (CUSUM) control charts for different change type scenarios. We also apply the Deviance Information Criterion as a model selection criterion in the Bayesian context, to find the best change point model for a given dataset where there is no prior knowledge about the change type in the process. In comparison with built-in estimators of EWMA and CUSUM charts and ML based estimators, the Bayesian estimator performs reasonably well and remains a strong alternative. These superiorities are enhanced when probability quantification, flexibility and generalizability of the Bayesian change point detection model are also considered.},

The second level contains fragments and flakes produced during the production of Laurel Leaf points, ranging in size from 25 to 35 cm, which were also broken during fabrication. The interpretation of the site as a workshop, based on the deficit of certain tools and blades, is nuanced by the abandonment of other rare tool types, which are shown by microwear analysis to have been utilized.},

This study relies on a knowledge of regional geology and field work to identify the sources of the lithic raw material found at C\^oa Valley Upper Palaeolithic sites. We expose the context of use and discard of flint, which is naturally absent from the region, and other local materials. From this, we present a GIS based analysis concerning space, time and least-cost paths travelled. This analysis, along with the environmental data available, forms a baseline to evaluate different anthropological models on hunter\textendash gatherer lithic use, mobility, and social networks. We conclude with a three-level model for social interaction, in the context of aggregation activities between different social meta-groups, which involves embedded procurement, long-distance raw material exchange, and symbolic community, reflected in the largest known open-air Upper Palaeolithic rock art concentration.},

  abstract = {The Australasian Antarctic Expedition (1911\textendash 1914), headed by Douglas Mawson, explored the largely uncharted Antarctic coast due south of Australia.  Mawson had been inspired to lead his own venture by his experiences on Ernest Shackleton's Nimrod expedition in 1907\textendash 1909. During its time in Antarctica, the expedition's sledging parties covered around 2,600 miles (4,180 km) of unexplored territory, while its ship, SY Aurora, navigated 1,800 miles (2,900 km) of unmapped coastline. Scientific activities included meteorological measurements, magnetic observations, an expansive oceanographic program, and the collection of many biological and geological samples, including the discovery of the first meteorite found in Antarctica. The expedition was the first to establish and maintain wireless contact between Antarctica and Australia. Another planned innovation \textendash{} the use of an aircraft \textendash{} was thwarted by an accident before the expedition sailed. The plane's fuselage was adapted to form a motorised sledge or "air-tractor", but it proved to be of very limited use.
The expedition was organised into three bases: one on the sub-Antarctic Macquarie Island and two on the Antarctic mainland. The main base, under Mawson's command, was set up at Cape Denison, about 300 miles (480 km) west of Cape Adare, and a western base under Frank Wild was established on the Shackleton Ice Shelf, more than 1,500 miles (2,410 km) west of Cape Denison. Activities at both mainland bases were hampered by extreme winds, which often made outside work impossible.
The expedition was marred by the deaths of two members during an attempt to reach Oates Land: Belgrave Edward Ninnis, who fell into a crevasse, and Xavier Mertz, who died on the harrowing return journey. Mawson, their sledging partner, was then forced to make an arduous solo trek back to base; he missed the ship, and had to spend an extra year at Cape Denison, along with a relief party of six. This sojourn was made difficult by the mental breakdown of Sidney Jeffryes, the wireless operator. When Mawson returned from Antarctica, he was given a hero's welcome and received many honours, including a knighthood. The scientific studies provided copious, detailed data which took thirty years to completely publish and the expedition's broad exploration program laid the groundwork for Australia's later territorial claims in Antarctica.},

  abstract = {The Lake Manyara area is the focus of several paleo-archeological investigations. The Manyara basin is located approximately 70 km east of Olduvai Gorge, where important paleoanthropological artifacts are traced back to Homo habilis. In the Manyara basin itself, two hominin-bearing sites (0.78\textendash 0.633 Ma) and plenty of vertebrate bones and teeth as well as stone artifacts from different periods were discovered, especially close to the Makuyuni River. Different methodological approaches with a main emphasis on remote sensing were utilized to contribute to the understanding of the paleo-landscape development. In order to investigate the morphotectonic evolution of the study area, lineaments were detected from Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite scenes. The complex lacustrine development of the Lake Manyara and its paleo-stages was investigated by delineating the extent of paleo-lake sediments (older than 0.633 Ma) with multispectral ASTER data. In addition, lake terraces and shorelines on different levels (up to 80 m above today's lake level) and an outlet to the neighboring Engaruka basin were detected by analyzing the backscattered intensity of TerraSAR-X data. The distribution of topsoils, identified from multisensory remote sensing datasets, indicates soil formation as well as erosional and depositional processes. The fossils and artifacts were then characterized, and their distribution probabilities were determined using a statistical model. The proposed methods contribute to a better understanding of the paleoenvironmental interrelations within the study area.},

  abstract = {Coastal South Africa draws interdisciplinary interests due to the co-occurrence of a rich record for early human behavioral modernity, hyper-diverse vegetation with very high endemism (the Cape Floral Region), and globally influential oceanic and climate systems. High resolution and continuous climate and environmental records are needed to provide the context for the evolution of behavioral modernity and this diverse flora. Here we present the first such record for climate and environmental change from 90 000 to 53 000 years ago from the southern Cape coast. This important time span covers a burst of expression of several indicators of human behavioral modernity, as well as several key cycles in global climate change. Our research location is ideally placed near the location of several critical archaeological sites, near the boundary of the winter and summer rainfall regimes, and close to isotopically distinct floral zones. We used isotopic analysis of precisely dated speleothems to document shifting vegetation and rainfall, and show that the presence of winter rain and C3 grasses waxes and wanes in response to Southern Hemisphere shifts in SSTs and global temperature. When proxies of global temperatures indicate warmer conditions, d18O and d13C indicate more winter rain and more C3 grasses, respectively, and vice versa. This record displays abrupt and short-term changes previously undocumented. It is often argued that the Cape Floral Region partially owes its high diversity to relative climatic stability. Our record shows isotopic variability that at least matches that displayed in the Levantine Mediterranean system, so climatic stability may not have characterized the south coast. One short-lived phase of human technological innovation (the Still Bay) associated with early evidence for behavioral modernity occurs synchronous with an abrupt environmental perturbation. Early modern humans in this region confronted a variable climate and adapted quickly in a manner similar to behaviorally modern humans.},

The site has long been known for its stratified succession of Stone Age horizons, in particular those representing the late Acheulean (Mode 2) and early Middle Stone Age (Mode 3). Previous efforts to date these horizons have provided, at best, minimum radiometric ages. The absence of a firm chronology for the site has limited its potential contribution to our understanding of the process of technological change in the Middle Pleistocene of south-central Africa. The aim of the excavations was to collect samples for luminescence dating that bracketed archaeological horizons, and to establish the sedimentary and palaeoenvironmental contexts of the deposits. Four sedimentary packages were identified with the oldest containing Mode 2 and Mode 3 horizons. In this paper we consider the implications of the luminescence ages for the archaeological record at Kalambo Falls, and place them in a regional context. The reworking and preservation of the archaeological horizons is interpreted as the result of successive phases of meander migration and aggradation. Limited pollen evidence suggests a persistent floodplain palaeoenvironment with intermittent swamp forest and adjacent valley woodland, while mineral magnetic susceptibility data support an interpretation of river flow variability without any significant change in sediment provenance. The dynamics of the fluvial system cannot as yet be linked directly with regional climate change. The age range of \textasciitilde 500\textendash 300 ka for the oldest sedimentary package places the Mode 2/3 succession firmly in the Middle Pleistocene, and contributes to an expanding African record of technological innovation before the evolution of Homo sapiens.},

          Fossil information is essential for estimating species divergence times, and can be integrated into Bayesian phylogenetic inference using the fossilized birth-death (FBD) process. An important aspect of palaeontological data is the uncertainty surrounding specimen ages, which can be handled in different ways during inference. The most common approach is to fix fossil ages to a point estimate within the known age interval. Alternatively, age uncertainty can be incorporated by using priors, and fossil ages are then directly sampled as part of the inference. This study presents a comparison of alternative approaches for handling fossil age uncertainty in analysis using the FBD process. Based on simulations, we find that fixing fossil ages to the midpoint or a random point drawn from within the stratigraphic age range leads to biases in divergence time estimates, while sampling fossil ages leads to estimates that are similar to inferences that employ the correct ages of fossils. Second, we show a comparison using an empirical dataset of extant and fossil cetaceans, which confirms that different methods of handling fossil age uncertainty lead to large differences in estimated node ages. Stratigraphic age uncertainty should thus not be ignored in divergence time estimation and instead should be incorporated explicitly.},

          Fossil information is essential for estimating species divergence times, and can be integrated into Bayesian phylogenetic inference using the fossilized birth-death (FBD) process. An important aspect of palaeontological data is the uncertainty surrounding specimen ages, which can be handled in different ways during inference. The most common approach is to fix fossil ages to a point estimate within the known age interval. Alternatively, age uncertainty can be incorporated by using priors, and fossil ages are then directly sampled as part of the inference. This study presents a comparison of alternative approaches for handling fossil age uncertainty in analysis using the FBD process. Based on simulations, we find that fixing fossil ages to the midpoint or a random point drawn from within the stratigraphic age range leads to biases in divergence time estimates, while sampling fossil ages leads to estimates that are similar to inferences that employ the correct ages of fossils. Second, we show a comparison using an empirical dataset of extant and fossil cetaceans, which confirms that different methods of handling fossil age uncertainty lead to large differences in estimated node ages. Stratigraphic age uncertainty should thus not be ignored in divergence time estimation and instead should be incorporated explicitly.},

  abstract = {Evidence for large-scale Lower\textendash Middle Paleolithic flint extraction in the southern Levant is presented in this paper. Four Paleolithic quarry and workshop complexes are introduced as case studies. A model for Lower\textendash Middle Paleolithic flint extraction is proposed that includes the following characteristics: 1) noteworthy physiographic settings and flint-rich limestone formations; 2) extensive landscape alteration by focused quarrying activities; 3) a variety of open-cast mining (surface quarrying) techniques; 4) a large number of stone waste piles (backfill piles), strategically aligned between exhausted extraction fronts; 5) mining tools fashioned from locally derived limestone or basalt; 6) flint workshops located on piles of extraction waste (tailings); 7) workshop assemblages rich in primary reduction products and blanks (tested nodules, cores, tool rejects and debitage), with formal shaped tools being rare or absent; and 8) workshop activities highlighted by the predominance of Levallois cores and debitage, and large flake production with a minor component of bifacial tool preforms. The study of such extensive Lower\textendash Middle Paleolithic ``industrial areas'' provides a glimpse into the diverse raw material procurement and exploitation strategies of early humans, as well as their impact on the pristine landscape. The history of quarry development, beginning with Lower Paleolithic mining activity, provides insights into general long-term trends in man's technological and cultural dynamics.},

  abstract = {The origins of agriculture have been debated by archaeologists for most of the discipline's history, no more so than in Island Southeast Asia. The orthodox view is that Neolithic farmers spread south by sea from mainland China to Taiwan and thence to Island Southeast Asia, taking with them a new material culture and domestic rice and pigs and speaking the precursor of the Austronesian languages that are spoken in the region today. Opponents of this `farming/language dispersal' theory have proposed models of acculturation, in which foragers acquired new material culture and food resources by trading with farmers. However, new work in archaeology, palaeoecology, palynology and anthropology, especially in Borneo, and in genetics and linguistics for the region as a whole, is suggesting that foraging/ farming transitions in Southeast Asia were far more complex than either of these opposing `grand narratives' of discontinuity (population colonisation) or continuity (acculturation) allows. Through the course of the Early/Mid-Holocene new material culture, technologies and foods were variously taken up, promoted or resisted in order to provision changes in the social and ideological constitution of societies. Whilst new readings of the data for foraging\textendash farming transitions in the region vary, a consensus is emerging that it is more useful to focus on how materials and modes of life were used to underwrite changes in social networks than to seek to explain the archaeological record in terms of migrating farmers or acculturating foragers.},

Evolution remains a controversial issue in the United States, particularly for evangelical Christians, who as a group have been a key player in anti-evolution education legislation. Religious cultural competence can be effective in decreasing undergraduate biology students' perceived conflict between religion and evolution. However, the impact on student populations who are particularly resistant to evolution is unknown. We explored the efficacy of culturally competent evolution education practices adapted for biology students in a genetics course at an evangelical Christian university. This included the presence of an instructor as a religious scientist role model who accepts evolution, and the use of the book The Language of God. We explored how this curriculum affected students' conceptions of religion and evolution using pre- and post-surveys. We found a differential impact of the curriculum: 31\% of the students who indicated that there was a conflict between their religious beliefs and evolution changed their conceptions to be more in line with scientific evidence, but the remaining 69\% did not. We describe reasons why, including students' perceptions of The Language of God. This research indicates the challenges of implementing culturally competent evolution education for evangelical students, given their strong commitment to biblical literalism and their lower likelihood of being convinced by scientific evidence for evolution.},

  abstract = {Social complexity has long been a subject of considerable interest and study among archaeologists; it is generally taken to refer to human societies consisting of large numbers of people, many social and economic roles, large permanent settlements, along with a variety of other marker criteria. When viewed from a more general complex systems perspective, however, all human societies are complex systems regardless of size or organizational structure. Complex adaptive systems (CAS) represent systems which are dynamic in space, time, organization, and membership and which are characterized by information transmission and processing that allow them to adjust to changing external and internal conditions. Complex systems approaches offer the potential for new insights into processes of social change, linkages between the actions of individual human agents and societal-level characteristics, interactions between societies and their environment, and allometric relationships between size and organizational complexity. While complex systems approaches have not yet coalesced into a comprehensive theoretical framework, they have identified important isomorphic properties of organization and behavior across diverse phenomena. However, it is difficult to operationalize complex systems concepts in archaeology using the descriptive/confirmatory statistics that dominate quantitative aspects of modern archaeological practice. These are not designed to deal with complex interactions and multilevel feedbacks that vary across space and time. Nor do narratives that simply state that societies are characterized by interacting agent/actors who share cultural knowledge, and whose interacting practices create emergent social-level phenomena add much to our understanding. New analytical tools are needed to make effective use of the conceptual tools of complex systems approaches to human social dynamics. Computational and systems dynamics modeling offer the first generation of such analytical protocols especially oriented towards the systematic study of CAS. A computational model of small-scale society with subsistence agriculture is used to illustrate the complexity of even ``simple'' societies and the potential for new modeling methods to assist archaeologists in their study.},

The contents of the pit minimally derive from 117 reduction sequences and quite probably at least twice that number. The dump includes waste products from all stages of knapping. The assemblage is described in detail, with an emphasis on the diagnostic debitage types produced by each knapping stage, and hence reflects the local blade-knapping tradition. The results contribute to understanding the character of the local bidirectional operational sequence at Kfar HaHoresh. This included the import of high quality flint nodules from specific outcrops elsewhere in the lower Galilee. In many cases the nodules were subjected to meticulous core pre-formation followed by serial blade production, core maintenance and core abandonment. Following the end of intensive knapping the waste products were carefully collected and dumped in the pit at the edge of the site, while the designated products (blades and tools) were locally distributed or cached for various reasons. The recognized lithic organization, together with the high quality of the blades and tools elsewhere on-site, is indicative of a specialized Middle/Late PPNB lithic workshop. The pattern recognized at Kfar HaHoresh, supplemented by recent discoveries of flint outcrops and nearby PPNB workshop sites at HaSollelim and Givat Rabi East, together with the evidence for a regional blade production center at the village of Yiftahel, demonstrates the importance of this technology within the lower Galilee PPNB.},

Therefore, the book's argument is shaped by analogies drawn selectively from the theory of organic evolution, and not from the theory and practice of political revolution. Three themes appear, with variations, throughout the study. The first is diversity: an acknowledgment of the vast numbers of different kinds of made things (artifacts) that long have been available to humanity. The second theme is necessity: the mistaken belief that humans are driven to invent new artifacts in order to meet basic biological needs such as food, shelter, and defense. And the third theme is technological evolution: an organic analogy that explains both the emergence of the novel artifacts and their subsequent selection by society for incorporation into its material life without invoking either biological necessity or technological process.},

  abstract = {For decades, researchers have employed sets of radiocarbon dates to reconstruct trends in ancient human pop\- ulations. The overarching assumption in this analysis is that the frequency of dates is proportional to the magnitude of past human activity. Thus, the distribution of summed or otherwise summarized dates is used to extrapolate population density and mobility patterns. There are, however, a number of underlying assumptions associated with this analysis that workers address to varying degrees and which, if false and not critically accounted for, will introduce bias, misrepresent the magnitude of activity, and ultimately prove misleading in archaeological interpretations. In this regard, research has so far mainly focused on correcting for the effects of time-dependent degradation of archaeological sites and constituent materials, calibration irregularities, and the efficacy of the statistical methods used. Assumptions directly related to sample processing in radiocarbon dating, however, are less discussed in `14C-dates-as-data' analyses. It is, for example, assumed that all carbonaceous materials will yield sufficient, endogenous carbon for radiocarbon measurement. Yet sample failure in radio\- carbon dating is common and contingent on, largely, deterministic factors such as post-depositional environ\- ment. Sets of radiocarbon dates analyzed, therefore, represent successful measurements independent of reliability. In this work, we discuss the biases introduced by challenges in radiocarbon processing and their impact on 14C-dates-as-data studies.},

  abstract = {Significant indirect evidence suggests that one of the Classic-period residential groups at Tikal was the residence of a family of potters who produced high-quality painted wares. Delineation of the borders of residential Group 4H-1 at Tikal led me to postulate that the bajo was a major resource zone for ceramic manufacturing rather than a spatially limiting feature. This family of upscale ceramic producers used the adjacent bajo as a source of clay and fuel for firing pottery. The configuration of other groups near Group 4H-1 suggests not only that the people occupying the several groups on this peninsula were related, but that they were all involved in the production, painting, and distribution of fine ceramics. These several residential groups, located on adjacent house lots, define a barrio within Tikal whose occupants formed an extended kin unit sharing an economic focus on the production of high-quality ceramics. A consideration of the contents of trash deposits that were used by the Maya for building fill and a study of the middens found adjacent to residential groups at Tikal provide clues to the location of a specific kiln, or firing area. Broken pottery in the structure fill tells us more than architectural history. In this example, pottery indicates how other aspects of one or more house lots were organized and used. In particular, these data suggest that a barrio-like cluster of households at Tikal, with its own ritual center (Group 5G-I), housed families of ceramic producers who had specifically located their residences in direct proximity to the bajo. The search for the firing facilities associated with the production of ceramics in Group 4H-1 is now a major research focus. ``Kilns,'' or firing facilities, should be among the various architectural features found ``out back,'' or located on the margins of a house lot. Kilns may have been of the trench type or free-standing small buildings, possibly within sheds, and are expected outside the perimeter formed by the main buildings of the residential group. The structures facing a plaza or series of plazas that are the most obvious elements of a single household tend to attract archaeological attention. Location of structures ``out back,'' or peripheral to the residential core buildings, could help define the configuration of household lots.},

It was soon after this that William Dickinson began analysing pottery sherds from various sites across the archipelago. He ultimately went on to study hundreds of samples, including \textendash{} most recently \textendash 112 from the site of Teouma on Efate Island. Early pottery sites remained elusive in the southern islands for two decades after the Shutlers' pioneering work and on Aneityum for nearly 50 years. Assessments of the island's geomorphology, a key aspect regularly emphasised by Dickinson, coupled with perseverance and some serendipitous test-pitting finally led to the discovery of a Lapita site on Aneityum. Dickinson's petrographic expertise was once again called on some 50 years after research first started on the island, to contribute to initial identification of the site's significance. We examine the difficulty of finding Lapita on Aneityum through a historical lens in order to reflect back on other presumed Lapita ``gaps'' that remain today, such as in much of the main Solomons' chain and \textendash{} with one current exception \textendash in Samoa. Perhaps the gaps in other regions are not as extensive as is often argued.},

  abstract = {The quest to explain demographic history during the early part of human evolution has been limited because of the scarce paleoanthropological record from the Middle Stone Age. To shed light on the structure of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) phylogeny at the dawn of Homo sapiens, we constructed a matrilineal tree composed of 624 complete mtDNA genomes from sub-Saharan Hg L lineages. We paid particular attention to the Khoi and San (Khoisan) people of South Africa because they are considered to be a unique relic of hunter-gatherer lifestyle and to carry paternal and maternal lineages belonging to the deepest clades known among modern humans. Both the tree phylogeny and coalescence calculations suggest that Khoisan matrilineal ancestry diverged from the rest of the human mtDNA pool 90,000\textendash 150,000 years before present (ybp) and that at least five additional, currently extant maternal lineages existed during this period in parallel. Furthermore, we estimate that a minimum of 40 other evolutionarily successful lineages flourished in sub-Saharan Africa during the period of modern human dispersal out of Africa approximately 60,000\textendash 70,000 ybp. Only much later, at the beginning of the Late Stone Age, about 40,000 ybp, did introgression of additional lineages occur into the Khoisan mtDNA pool. This process was further accelerated during the recent Bantu expansions. Our results suggest that the early settlement of humans in Africa was already matrilineally structured and involved small, separately evolving isolated populations.},

  abstract = {Migration is a key driver of human cultural and genetic evolution, with recent theoretical advances calling for work to accurately identify factors behind early colonization patterns. However, inferring prehistoric migration strategies is a controversial field of inquiry that largely relies on interpreting settlement chronologies and constructing plausible narratives around environmental factors. Model selection approaches, along with new statistical models that match the dynamic nature of colonization, offers a more rigorous framework to test competing theories. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by developing an Island-Level Model of Colonization adapted from epidemiology in a Bayesian model-selection framework. Using model selection techniques, we assess competing colonization theories of Near and Remote Oceania, showing that models of exploration angles and risk performed considerably better than models using inter-island distance, suggesting early seafarers were already adept at long-distance travel. These results are robust after artificially increasing the uncertainty around settlement times. We show how decades of thinking on colonization strategies can be brought together and assessed in one statistical framework, providing us with greater interpretive power to understand a fundamental feature of our past.

            La migraci\'on es un factor clave de la evoluci\'on cultural y gen\'etica humana. Recientamente, los avances te\'oricos que requieren esfuerzos para identificar los factores que respaldan los modelos de la colonizaci\'on primaria. Sin embargo, la investigaci\'on para infer ir estrategias de migraci\'on es un tema pol\'emico que se basa en gran parte en la interpretaci\'on de las cronolog\'ias de asentamiento y la creaci\'on de narrativas plausibles en torno a factores ambientales. Los criterios de selecci\'on de modelo,junto con los nuevos modelos estad\'isticos que responden a la naturaleza din\'amica de la colonizaci\'on, ofrecen un m\'etodo m\'as riguroso para poner a prueba las teor\'ias en pugna. Demostramos la utilidad de este enfoque mediante el desarrollo de un Modelo de Colonizaci\'on de Islas, adaptado de la epidemiolog\'ia, con una especiftcaci\'on bayesiana. Usando t\'ecnicas de selecci\'on de modelo, evaluamos teor\'ias divergentes de colonizaci\'on de la Ocean{$\acute{\iota}$}a Cercana y Lejana, y demostramos que los modelos de los \'angulos de exploraci\'on y riesgo son considerablemente m\'as respaldados que los modelos que utilizan la distancia entre las islas, lo que sugiere que los primeros marinos ya eran m\'as adeptos a los viajes de larga distancia. Estos resultados son robustos aun despu\'es de un aumento artificial de la incertidumbre en torno a los tiempos de la colonizaci\'on. Este an\'olisis muestra c\'omo d\'ecadas de teor\'ia sobre las estrategias de colonizaci\'on pueden ser compiladas y evaluadas en un enfoque estad\'istico que nos ofrece una mayor capacidad de interpretaci\'on de las caracter\'isticas fundamentales de nuestro pasado.},

  abstract = {Loberg Lake, Alaska was colonized by sea-run Gasterosteus aculeatus between 1983 and 1988, after the original stickleback population was exterminated. Annual samples from 1990 to 2001 reveal substantial evolution of lateral plate (armor) phenotypes. The 1990 sample was nearly monomorphic for the complete plate morph, which is monomorphic in local sea-run populations; the low plate morph, which is usually monomorphic in local freshwater populations, was absent. By 2001, the frequency of completes had declined to 11I\%, and lows had increased to 75 \%. The partial plate morph and two unusual intermediate plate phenotypes were generally rare, but occurrence of the intermediates was unexpected. These intermediate phenotypes rarely occur in other, presumably older, polymorphic populations. When low morphs first appeared, they averaged 6.8 plates per side, indicating that the ancestral plate number of low morphs is high, and their mean has subsequently declined. Contemporary evolution in this population indicates that threespine stickleback adapt to freshwater habitats within decades after invasion from the ocean, and thus phenotypes in most populations are adapted to current conditions.},

  abstract = {Archaeological theory has traditionally presupposed the existence of ``battleship curves'' in stylistic evolution, with little understanding about what governs the width (variant frequency) or length (variant lifespan) of these curves. In terms of these variables, we propose that there is a testable difference between independent decisions, unbiased transmission, and biased transmission in cultural evolution. We expect independent decision making to be represented by an exponential distribution of variant prevalence in the population. In contrast, unbiased transmission tends to be characterized by a power law or log-normal distribution of prevalence, while biased transmission should deviate significantly from the unbiased case. The difference between these categories may be fundamental to how cultural traits spread and persist. In order to make analytical predictions for unbiased transmission, we adapt a model of stochastic network growth that, by quantitatively demonstrating the inherent nonlinearity in unbiased transmission, can explain why a few highly popular styles can be expected to emerge in the course of cultural evolution. For the most part, this model predicts the frequencies of pottery decorations remarkably well over a 400-year span of Linearbandkeramik settlement in the Merzbach valley. Because the highest frequencies of actual motifs are somewhat less than predicted by our unbiased transmission model, we identify an anti-conformist, or pro-novelty, bias in the later phases of the Neolithic Merzbach Valley.

            Resumen
            La teor\'ia arqueol\'ogica ha presupuesto tradicionalmente la existencia de las ``battleship curves'' en la evoluci\'on estil\'istica, con poca comprensi\'on sobre qu\'e dicta la anchura (variable frecuencia) o la longitud (variable lapso de vida) de estas curvas. Con estas variables, proponemos que hay una diferencia comprobable entre decisiones independientes, transmisi\'on no sesgada y transmisi\'on sesgada en la evoluci\'on cultural. Encontramos que la toma de decisi\'on independiente es representada por una distribuci\'on exponential del predominio variable en la poblaci\'on. En contraste, la transmisi\'on no sesgada tiende para ser caracterizada por una distribuci\'on power-law o una distribuci\'on log-normal del predominio, mientras que el caso de transmisi\'on sesgada se diferencia del caso de transmisi\'on no-sesgada. La diferencia entre estas categor\'i as puede ser fundamental para la evoluci\'on cultural. Para hacer las predicciones de la transmisi\'on no-sesgada, adaptamos un modelo de la red de crecimiento en el que, demostrando cuantitativamente la no-linealidad inherente en la transmisi\'on no-sesgada, pueda explicar como se puede esperar que algunos estilos altamente populares emerjan en el curso de la evoluci\'on cultural. Este modelo predice notablemente bien las frecuencias de las decoraciones de la cer\'amica durante 400 a\~nos de la era Neolitica en el valle de Merzbach. Porque nuestro modelo predice m\'as estilos de la cer\'amica con alta frecuencia de los que hay realmente, identificamos un sesgo anticonformista, o favorable a la novedad en las fases mas tard\'ias del valle Neolitico de Merzbach.},

At the same time, trends and fashions are constantly changing, with future outcomes potentially irrational and nearly impossible to predict. A simple null model, which captures these seemingly conflicting tendencies of conformity and change, involves the random copying of cultural variants between individuals, with occasional innovation. Here, we show that the random-copying model predicts a continual flux of initially obscure new ideas (analogous to mutations) becoming highly popular by chance alone, such that the turnover rate on a list of most popular variants depends on the list size and the amount of innovation but not on population size. We also present evidence for remarkably regular turnover on bpop chartsQ\textemdash including the most popular music, first names, and dog breeds in 20th-century United States\textemdash which fits this expectation. By predicting parametric effects on the turnover of popular fashion, the random-copying model provides an additional means of characterizing collective copying behavior in culture evolution.},

  abstract = {Hopi villages played important roles in the precontact and contact periods in the American Southwest, but analysis has largely focused on their occupants' longdistance contacts with non-Hopi populations. Relatively little direct archaeological evidence has been mustered to document intervillage relationships on the Hopi Mesas. The lack of attention to intervillage dynamics risks encouraging an overly homogeneous view of Hopi as a sociopolitical or ethnic entity. This study employs compositional analysis of Jeddito Yellow Ware pottery to track the local movement of pottery among Hopi villages and thus map patterns of interaction among them. The circulation of pottery is found to differ over time and by ceramic type, with bichromes moving within mesas and polychromes more often between mesas. Prior to Spanish contact, the Hopi settlement cluster contained a number of localized social networks rather than a single, all-encompassing network.},

Cycles of sedimentation and soil development have been recognised, and are tentatively interpreted as reflecting the Dansgaard/Oeschger climatic cycles. From bottom to top, the sequence shows a trend to progressive reduction in length (and/or intensity) of the soil-forming periods and conversely, an increase in frost-related processes and sedimentation. Cambisols, associated with significant clay weathering and decalcification, developed at the base of the sequence (!35 to w30 14C kyr BP). They are then replaced by simple carbonate-rich humus horizons during the interval w30 to w28 14C kyr BP. At the beginning of MIS 2, the talus dynamics shifts from rockfall accumulation with intense snow-induced washing to stone-banked solifluction lobes in connection to a semi-desert-like periglacial environment. \'O 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Statistical analysis of these points demonstrates that 80\% of the variation in metrical attributes (e.g., length, width) is accounted for by the mean of the attribute, suggesting that this variation is independent of the transmission process and primarily due to production in which error tolerances are relative, not absolute. The remaining variation, specifically, metrical variability that is substantially greater or less than normally occurs as a consequence of these relative production tolerances, is only partly consistent with transmission theory expectations. More complex point shapes show less metrical variation than simple forms, and arrow points show less metrical variation than dart points, as predicted. There is substantial variation by section, point type, and measurement, however, that remains unexplained by the transmission hypothesis.},

  abstract = {Decrease in projectile point size around 1350 B.P. is commonly regarded as marking the replacement of the atlatl by the bow and arrow across the Great Basin. The point typology most widely employed in the Great Basin before about 1980 (the Berkeley typology) uses weight to distinguish larger dart points from smaller, but similarly shaped, arrow points. The typology commonly used today (the Monitor typology) uses basal width to distinguish wide-based dart points from narrow-based arrow points. The two typologies are in general agreement except in central Nevada, where some dart points are light, hence incorrectly typed by the Berkeley typology, and in eastern California, where some arrow points are wide-based, hence incorrectly typed by the Monitor typology. Scarce raw materials and resharpening may explain why dart points are sometimes light in central Nevada. That arrow point basal width is more variable in eastern California than central Nevada likely reflects differences in the cultural processes attending the spread and subsequent maintenance of bow-and-arrow technology in these two localities.

Tipicamente, estos dos sistemas de tipolog\'ia est\'an de acuerdo con la excepti\'on de Nevada central donde algunas puntas proyectil ligeras est\'an clasificadas equivocamente en la tipolog\'ia de Berkeley. Adem\'as, en California oriental algunas puntas de proyectil tienen bases anchas y est\'an clasificadas equivocamente en la tipolog\'ia Monitor.

Here, we estimate potential timings and routes out of Africa by deriving anthropologically and ecologically plausible precipitation requirements for human existence, and applying them to high-resolution palaeoclimate reconstructions for the past 300k years. We find that exit routes and timings previously suggested based on archaeological and genetic evidence coincide precisely with the presence of sufficiently wet corridors into Eurasia, while the gaps between the proposed exit timings co-occur with periods of insufficient rainfall. This demonstrates the key role that palaeoclimatic conditions played for out-of-Africa expansions. The challenging environmental conditions outside of Africa that occurred between windows of potential contact, coupled with the lack of a demographic rescue effect from migration and possible competition with other hominins, likely explain the demise of early colonists prior to the large-scale colonisation of the world beginning from \textasciitilde 65kya.},

Middle Stone Age (MSA) artifacts are also present on the slope in front of the rockshelter. Extensive, systematic excavations in 2006 and 2010 by members of the Iringa Region Archaeological Project (IRAP) illustrate a complex picture of repeated occupations and reuse of the rockshelter during an important time in human history. Direct dates on Achatina shell and ostrich eggshell (OES) beads suggest that the earliest occupation levels excavated at Mlambalasi, which are associated with human burials, are terminal Pleistocene in age. This is exceptional given the rarity of archaeological sites, particularly those with human remains and other preserved organic material, from subtropical Africa between 200,000 and 10,000~years before present. This paper reports on the excavations to date and analysis of artifactual finds from the site. The emerging picture is one of varied, ephemeral use over millennia as diverse human groups were repeatedly attracted to this fixed feature on the landscape.},

Overall, although the measurement of length, breadth and thickness with hand-held callipers was reasonably accurate/precise, the estimation of L1, cortex, rolling and patination/staining was highly variable. Recommendations are made for projects recruiting students to measure lithics, for candidates setting out on a PhD involving the recording of lithics and for organisations who might consider establishing reference collections to enable researchers to standardise the assessments they need to make on handaxes.},

Internal and external factors accelerated processes of cultural change, particularly during periods of conflict, coalescence, and encroachment. This review considers the historical development of Northern Iroquoian societies from the beginning of the Late Woodland through the colonial era.

We draw upon ancestral Wendat site relocation sequences on the north shore of Lake Ontario, Ontario, Canada to explore factors influencing village relocation and how the continued abandonment of village sites created ancestral landscapes that included sites of pilgrimage, resource extraction, and ceremony. As communities of the dead, abandoned villages and associated ossuaries were part of a larger set of spiritual responsibilities to meaningful places in the landscape. As ancestral sites, these places were part of ongoing processes of emplacement through which Wendat communities laid claim to politically-defined territories.},

  abstract = {Mobile hunter-gatherers are often characterized as living in small communities where mobility and group size are products of the environmentally determined distribution of resources, and where social organization is multi-scalar: groups of co-residents are nested within small communities that are, in turn, nested within small-scale societies. Such organization is often assumed to be reflective of the human past, emerging as human cognition and communication evolved through earlier fission-fusion social processes, typical of many primate social systems. We review the history of this assumption in light of recent empirical data of co-residence and social networks among contemporary huntergatherers. We suggest that while residential and foraging groups are often small, there is little evidence that these groups are drawn from small communities nested within small-scale societies. Most mobile hunter-gatherers live in groups dominated by links between non-relatives, where residential group membership is fluid and supports large-scale social networks of interaction. We investigate these dynamics with fine-grained observational data on Martu foraging groups and social organization in Australia's Western Desert. The composition of Martu foraging groups is distinct from that of residential groups, although both are dominated by ties between individuals who have no close biological relationships. The number of individuals in a foraging group varies with habitat quality, but in a dynamic way, as group size is shaped by ecological legacies of land use. The flexible size and composition of foraging groups link individuals across their ``estates'': spatially explicit storehouses of ritual and relational wealth, inherited across generations through maintaining expansive networks of social interaction in a large and complex society. We propose that human cognition is tied to development of such expansive social relationships and co-evolved with dynamic socio-ecological interactions expressed in large-scale networks of relational wealth.},

In particular, we found the more collective polities to be comparatively more socially complex in part because the central offices of the state develop stronger controls over local institutions across the realm and across social sectors. In this paper we follow up on this original work to investigate the consequences of collective state-building in urban settings. We look especially at intra-urban transportation and communication as measured by urban population density and the efficiency and legibility of road layout. Although urban form reflects the operation of multiple causal forces, we provisionally conclude that collective action is one force shaping cities because it presupposes certain characteristic patterns of movement and, hence, spatial structure.},

  abstract = {From our previous comparative research on historic state formation we found that collective statebuilding entailed significant social and cultural change. In particular, we found the more collective polities to be comparatively more socially complex in part because the central offices of the state develop stronger controls over local institutions across the realm and across social sectors. In this paper we follow up on this original work to investigate the consequences of collective state-building in urban settings. We look especially at intra-urban transportation and communication as measured by urban population density and the efficiency and legibility of road layout. Although urban form reflects the operation of multiple causal forces, we provisionally conclude that collective action is one force shaping cities because it presupposes certain characteristic patterns of movement and, hence, spatial structure.},

Hafting first appears in Africa and Western Eurasia across the transition from Late Acheulean to Middle Palaeolithic technologies \textasciitilde{} 300\textendash 200 thousand years ago (ka). Hafting technology in South Asia may have emerged as a result of a local innovation, through cultural diffusion or a population dispersal. The resolution of the South Asian Palaeolithic records has improved significantly over the past decade, enabling examination of patterns of change through time in stone tool technologies. Although functional studies of tool use remain limited in the region, a range of indices of hafting appear in stone tool assemblages that offer the first means to evaluate the origins of hafting in South Asia. Rare examples appear in Middle Pleistocene contexts, but indices of hafting appear repeatedly in Middle Palaeolithic assemblages dating within the past 100 thousand years and are commonplace amongst Late Palaeolithic assemblages dating within the past 45 thousand years. This dataset remains too immature to authoritatively resolve between alternate models for the origins of hafting, whereas direct association with discrete hominin populations is hampered by the region's scant fossil record. Nevertheless, this examination of the origin of hafting technology presents the means to reorient approaches to Late Pleistocene behavioural change in South Asia and integrate them within global debates regarding hominin innovation, demographic interaction and population expansion.},

  abstract = {South Asia has a rich Palaeolithic heritage, and chronological resolution for this record has substantially improved over the past decade as a result of focused, interdisciplinary research at a number of key sites. Expanding the spatial diversity of dated Palaeolithic sites in South Asia grows increasingly important to examine how patterns of change through time vary within and between the region's diverse habitats. Critically, alternate models of modern human dispersals into South Asia highlight the significance of either coastal or continental routes of dispersal, but currently no coastal Palaeolithic sites directly dating to the timeframe of human expansions are known. Our previous research in Kachchh was the first study to clearly identify the presence of Palaeolithic sites in Late Pleistocene landscapes in close proximity to the Indian Ocean coastline. Here, we present the first results of surface survey and test excavation at the site of Sandhav (Kachchh, India), approximately 25 km from the modern shoreline. We characterise the geomorphology of the landscape, highlighting multiple phases of alluvial aggradation and postdepositional carbonate formation, associated with Palaeolithic artefacts. To date, excavations have tested the uppermost Pleistocene deposit, yielding a small collection of fresh Middle Palaeolithic artefacts associated with a luminescence age dating to the first half of MIS 5 (\textasciitilde 114 ka), which provides a minimum age for Late Acheulean artefacts in underlying units. We discuss our findings in the context of debates surrounding the timing, lithic technologies, and ecologies associated with the expansions of modern humans into South Asia.},

Surovell et al. (2009) presented a global taphonomic correction model based on radiocarbon ages from volcanic deposits that has since been used by several researchers for paleodemographic reconstructions. This method is based on the assumption that the best indicator of relative human population density over time is not the absolute abundance of archaeological materials over time but, instead, the abundance of cultural material relative to geologic contexts in which those materials can occur. To verify the Surovell et al. model, in this paper we take 2457 radiocarbon ages from geologic contexts collected from published literature to create an independent model of taphonomic bias. We find that between 1 and 39 ka, the two curves are largely indistinguishable, but that they diverge in recent times. This suggests that current global models of taphonomic correction can be used to reconstruct human populations for the late Quaternary, but that demographic reconstructions remain challenging for the most recent two millennia.},

The bottom set, slightly more than 60 cm thick, was trapped between the bedrock (upon which it rested) and the lower part of the roof fall (reaching more than 1 m in the excavation area), and yielded some charcoal without other archaeological material. New excavations, however, have revealed the presence of artifacts, additional charcoal, and an alignment of sandstone blocks providing clear boundaries for the artifact concentration. The typological and technological composition of the artifacts is classic, with tools made by shaping high-quality quartz pebbles and tools made on shaping chips or on chips obtained by bipolar percussion of quartz blocks. Quartzite was also used, but only in the manufacture of larger tools, of certain types. The toolkit is made of several convergent pieces, denticulates, rostres, scrapers, and end scrapers. Radiocarbon dating results indicate a Pleistocene age, corresponding to the end of the midUpper Pleistocene (MIS3). These dates confirm that S\'itio do Meio is the seventh Pleistocene stratigraphic sequence known from a 20-km-radius zone, coming from different sedimentary horizons, testifying to a human presence that extends from MIS3 until the middle Holocene, in this region of Piau\'i. Particularly, we observed that this occupation still has periodic gaps, with phases of occupation occurring in either short or long periods. With the new data, we are able to consider the cultural specificities of each set in the context of climate data to better understand the diversity of occupation within a single territory, for example behavioral variation in the management of space, adaptive responses to environmental pressures, or potentially both at the same time.},

They are also the only chimpanzees seen to pound objects with tools and to combine two different tool uses to get access to one food item. Tool making is the rule for abundant material (grass, twigs), but appears to be rarer for scarce, hard material (clubs, stones). Factors involved in the acquisition and the benefit of tool use are discussed along with factors affecting the frequency and complexity of tool making in chimpanzees.},

When predicting the response for a new functional predictor value, a semi-metric is used to compute the distances between the new and the previously observed functional predictors. Then each pair in the original sample is weighted according to a decreasing function of these distances. A Weighted (Linear) Distance-Based Regression is fitted, where the weights are as above and the distances are given by a possibly different semi-metric. This approach can be extended to nonparametric predictions from other kinds of explanatory variables (e.g., data of mixed type) in a natural way.},

  abstract = {Spatial structures may not only result from ecological interactions, they may also play an essential functional role in organizing the interactions. Modeling spatial patterns at multiple spatial and temporal scales is thus a crucial step to understand the functioning of ecological communities. PCNM (principal coordinates of neighbor matrices) analysis achieves a spectral decomposition of the spatial relationships among the sampling sites, creating variables that correspond to all the spatial scales that can be perceived in a given data set. The analysis then finds the scales to which a data table of interest responds. The significant PCNM variables can be directly interpreted in terms of spatial scales, or included in a procedure of variation decomposition with respect to spatial and environmental components. This paper presents four applications of PCNM analysis to ecological data representing combinations of: transect or surface data, regular or irregular sampling schemes, univariate or multivariate data. The data sets include Amazonian ferns, tropical marine zooplankton, chlorophyll in a marine lagoon, and oribatid mites in a peat bog. In each case, new ecological knowledge was obtained through PCNM analysis.},

  abstract = {The Mantel correlogram is an elegant way to compute a correlogram for multivariate data. However, recent papers raised concerns about the power of the Mantel test itself. Hence the question: Is the Mantel correlogram powerful enough to be useful? To explore this issue, we compared the performances of the Mantel correlogram to those of other methods, using numerical simulations based on random, normally distributed data. For a single response variable, we compared it to the Moran and Geary correlograms. Type I error rates of the three methods were correct. Power of the Mantel correlogram was nearly as high as that of the univariate methods. For the multivariate case, the test of the multivariate variogram developed in the context of multiscale ordination is in fact a Mantel test, so that the power of the two methods is the same by definition. We devised an alternative permutation test based on the variance, which yielded similar results. Overall, the power of the Mantel test was high, the method successfully detecting spatial correlation at rates similar to the permutation test of the variance statistic in multivariate variograms. We conclude that the Mantel correlogram deserves its place in the ecologist's toolbox.},

  abstract = {Archaeologists have regarded social networks as both the links through which people transmitted information and goods as well as a form of social storage creating relationships that could be drawn upon in times of subsistence shortfalls or other deleterious environmental conditions. In this article, formal social network analytical (SNA) methods are applied to archaeological data from the late preHispanic North American Southwest to look at what kinds of social networks characterized those regions that were the most enduring versus those that were depopulated over a 250-year period (A.D. 1200\textendash 1450). In that time, large areas of the Southwest were no longer used for residential purposes, some of which corresponds with welldocumented region-wide drought. Past research has demonstrated that some population levels could have been maintained in these regions, yet regional scale depopulation occurred. We look at the degree to which the network level property of embeddedness, along with population size, can help to explain why some regions were depopulated and others were not. SNA can help archaeologists examine why emigration occurred in some areas following an environmental crisis while other areas continued to be inhabited and even received migrants. Moreover, we modify SNA techniques to take full advantage of the time depth and spatial and demographic variability of our archaeological data set. The results of this study should be of interest to those who seek to understand human responses to past, present, and future worldwide catastrophes since it is now widely recognized that responses to major human disasters, such as hurricanes, were ``likely to be shaped by pre-existing or new social networks'' (as reported by Suter et al. (Research and Policy Review 28:1\textendash 10, 2009)).},

This complex mixture of interacting spheres, together with the identification of cultural-social boundaries, enables us to understand and explain inter-site variation in material culture and mortuary practices. Moreover, they reflect the growing social complexity of large farming communities at the end of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic and the role played by settlement as the social unit through which these communities became more distinctive and self-consciously different.},

ModiWcations in stone-tool repair and replacement are inXuenced by changes in past environments, resources, and the economic and settlement strategies of these Later Stone Age hunter\textendash gatherers. The technological approaches range from time-minimization tactics to resource-maximization tactics. Time-minimization tactics favor the intense curation of extractive tools and the expedient use of maintenance tools, while resource-maximization tactics employ a more rapid replacement of extractive tools coupled with intense curation of maintenance tools. Time-minimization tactics occur with lower risk wetter conditions and the selection of larger animals for prey, while resource-maximization tactics correspond to higher risk conditions during drier periods and the more intensive exploitation of smaller animals. EYcient technologies were also employed for the rapid production of backed microlithic tools, but this does not appear to be in response to economic or environmental factors.},

  abstract = {Rehydroxylation ceramic dating, a new technique that has shown promise as an archaeometric breakthrough, was applied to XIX-century samples of Davenport ceramics from Parowan, Utah in the United States. The samples were dried to remove both physically and chemically bonded water and then exposed to a air with 20\% relative humidity to record the progression of rehydration/rehydroxylation over a period of 40 days. Both time1/4 and time1/n analyses were applied to the experimental mass gain vs. time results in an attempt to find the most appropriate treatment for the data. The time1/4 analysis yielded poor reproducibility and non-ideal fitting results to the Stage II mass gain, in which water reacts with meta-clays. Application of the time1/n model improved the apparent linearity of Stage II mass gain in small samples. However, the time1/n treatment still provided a poor fit to data from larger specimens, indicating that some secondary effects related to sample size and water transport may exist. To examine the effects of transport, a pulverized sample of the same material was analyzed, resulting in improved sampleto-sample agreement in time1/n irrespective of mass variations. These findings have implications on the application of rehydroxylation ceramic dating.},

However, cumulative cultural evolution resulting in behaviours that no individual could invent on their own is limited to humans, song birds, and perhaps chimpanzees. Circumstantial evidence suggests that cumulative cultural evolution requires the capacity for observational learning. Here, we analyse two models of the evolution of psychological capacities that allow cumulative cultural evolution. Both models suggest that the conditions which allow the evolution of such capacities when rare are much more stringent than the conditions which allow the maintenance of the capacities when common. This result follows from the fact that the assumed benefit of the capacities, cumulative cultural adaptation, cannot occur when the capacities are rare. These results suggest why such capacities may be rare in nature.},

My cross-cultural analysis supports the hypothesis that social stratification is associated with horizontal social learning as represented by the frequency children play games. Additionally, however, a high percentage of play across the cultures analyzed represented spontaneous, creative play, indicative of a strong and universal preference for individual learning, which is conducive to innovation. My analysis of the settings of Aka forager and Ngandu farmer children's play problematizes the idea that vertical and oblique cultural transmission is in practice the movement of information from older to younger individuals. In fact, children's imitation of traditional (i.e., learned from adults) activities in play often occurred away from adults. These results are discussed in light of previous studies of play and cultural transmission.},

Today, the pre-Clovis occupation at the Monte Verde site is widely accepted, several other pre-Clovis sites are well documented, investigations of terminal Pleistocene subaerial and submerged Pacific Coast landscapes have increased, and multiple lines of evidence are helping decode the nature of early human dispersals into the Americas. Misconceptions remain, however, about the state of knowledge, productivity, and deglaciation chronology of Pleistocene coastlines and possible technological connections around the Pacific Rim. We review current evidence for several significant clusters of early Pacific Coast archaeological sites in North and South America that include sites as old or older than Clovis. We argue that stemmed points, foliate points, and crescents (lunates) found around the Pacific Rim may corroborate genomic studies that support an early Pacific Coast dispersal route into the Americas. Still, much remains to be learned about the Pleistocene colonization of the Americas, and multiple working hypotheses are warranted.},

Fifty-nine radiocarbon ages make Mochena Borago one of the best-dated Late Pleistocene archaeological sites in eastern and northeastern Africa. However, complex site formation processes, dramatic stratigraphic differences between non-contiguous excavation areas, and ``outlier'' dates that appear in various parts of Mochena Borago's sequence, complicate efforts to develop a secure and detailed chronology for local and regional behavioral changes. This article focuses on contiguous squares within the Block Excavation Area (BXA) trench at the northern end of the shelter. Bayesian modeling of thirty-seven dates from six major lithostratigraphic units within the BXA yields a revised series of age ranges; these differ from the previous age model (derived from weighted means) in subtle but important ways. Perspectives gained through Bayesian analysis stimulate more careful consideration of the complex site formation processes operating at Mochena Borago, the contextual integrity of the site's robust and distinctive flaked stone artifact assemblages (lithics), and potential correlations between lithic changes and environmental events that occur on local, regional, and global scales. As these factors come into focus, Mochena Borago can serve as an important chronological benchmark to better understand human behavior in eastern and northeastern Africa around the time of the second major dispersal of Homo sapiens.},

  abstract = {Detecting and diagnosing the causes of change through time in archaeological assemblages is a core enterprise of archaeology. Evolutionary approaches to this problem typically cast the causes of culture change as being either stochastic in origin, or arising from selection. Stochastic sources of change include random innovations, copying errors, drift and founder effects among dispersing groups. Selection is driven by differences in payoffs between cultural variants. Most efforts to identify these evolutionary forces in the archaeological record have relied on assessing how well the predictions from a neutralstochastic model of cultural transmission fit a data set. Selection is inferred when the neutral-stochastic model fits poorly. A problem with this approach is that it does not test directly for the presence selection. Moreover, it does not account for the fact that both neutral-stochastic and selective forces can act at the same time on the same cultural variants. A different approach based on the Price Equation allows for the simultaneous measurement of selective and stochastic forces. This paper extends use of the Price Equation to the analysis of selective and stochastic forces operating on multiple artifact types within an assemblage. Ceramic data presented by Steele et al. (2010, Vol. 37(6): 1348e1358) from the Late Bronze Age Hittite site of Bog azk\"oy-Hattusa, Turkey, provide an opportunity to evaluate the efficacy of this model. The results suggest that selection is a dominant process driving the frequency evolution of different bowl rim types within the assemblage and that stochastic forces played little or no role. It is also clear, however, that we should be attentive to combinations of direct and indirect selective effects within assemblages consisting of multiple artifact types.},

It also is the source of much disagreement about how we should conceive of the processes of culture change. Evolutionary archaeologists tend to view archaeological attributes as either functional, if they respond to selection, or stylistic, if they do not. Others tend to see style and function as operating simultaneously. A resolution to this problem is proposed through development of a formal mathematical model of style- and function-based evolution using a hypothetical example of temporal patterns of ceramic decoration within a community of household-based potters. Simple replicator equations are proposed to describe the household-scale dynamics of change in the relative frequency of ceramic decoration. These low-level dynamics can be distinguished on the basis of whether or not change is correlated with some measure of performance, utility, or payoff. The replicator equations are then used to derive several versions of the Price Equation (Price 1970), a very general and powerful statement about total evolutionary change in any system. At this scale of analysis, total change is similarly partitioned into payoff-correlated (functional) and payoff-independent (stylistic) contributions and it is shown that these processes are likely to operate simultaneously. Tests of the model against simulated data show that it is possible to estimate with considerable accuracy the strength of functional and stylistic contributions to culture change under ideal conditions of site preservation. Further theoretical work is needed, however, to understand how diverse site formation and disturbance processes might impact application of the model in real archaeological settings.

            R\'esum\'e
            La dicotom\'ia entre estilo y funci\'on est\'a en la base del programa de investigaci\'on de la arqueolog\'ia evolucionista. Tambi\'en es el origen de mucho desacuerdo sobre c\'omo debemos imaginar los procesos de cambio cultural. Los arque\'ologos evolucionistas clasifican los atributos arqueol\'ogicos como funcionales, si responden a selecci\'on, o estil\'isticos, si no lo hacen. Otros piensan que estilo y funci\'on opera al mismo tiempo. Se propone una resoluci\'on para este problema mediante el desarrollo de un modelo matem\'atico de evoluci\'on basado en estilo y funci\'on, usando un ejemplo hipot\'etico de patrones temporales de la decoraci\'on en la cer\'amica en una comunidad de ceramistas organizadas en unidades dom\'esticas. Se proponen ecuaciones sencillas replicadoras para describir, en la escala de las unidades dom\'esticas, las din\'amicas de cambio en la frecuencia relativa de decoraci\'on de la cer\'amica. Puede distinguir entre estas din\'amicas de bajo nivel si los cambios tienen correlaci\'on con realizaci\'on, utilidad, o recompensa, o no. Se usa las ecuaciones replicador para obtener diferentes versiones de la Ecuaci\'on Price (Price 1970), una declaraci\'on general y fuerte sobre cambio evolutivo en un sistema. En esta escala de an\'alisis, el cambio total est\'a dividido en contribuciones funcionales (que tienen una correlaci\'on con recompensa) y contribuciones estil\'isticos (que no tienen correlaci\'on con recompensa), y se demuestra que estos procesos funcionan al mismo tiempo. Pruebas de este modelo usando datos simulados demuestran que es posible, con mucha precisi\'on, estimar la importancia de contribuciones funci\'onales y contribuci\'ones estil\'isticas bajo de coediciones ideales de conservaci\'on de sitios arqueol\'ogicos. Sin embargo, necesitamos m\'as investigaciones te\'oricas para comprender c\'omo los procesos diversos de la formaci\'on y alteraci\'on de sitios arqueol\'ogicos afectan la aplicaci\'on de este modelo en situaciones arqueol\'ogicas reales.},

There are a number of essential aspects concerning the hypotheses and theories about the geographical and chronological dispersion of early African populations. In this context, special importance is due to the more recent human skeletal finds from Eastern and Southern Africa. They suggest, among other things, a much earlier presence of the Negrid combination of characteristics in these parts of the continent.

The cranium was not in primary context. Yet the morphology of this hominid permits it to be quite reliably assigned to archaic Homo sapiens, which was present in East Africa up until the early Upper Pleistocene. For the skull possesses a number of ancestral features on the vault and face that can also be found with other African specimens of archaic Homo sapiens which lived between 200 000 and 100 000 years B.P. it thus appears most likely that the new find from Turkana also dates from this period.

Der Sch\"adel fand sich nicht in prim\"arem Kontext. Die Morphologie des Hominiden erlaubt aber dennoch eine recht zuverl\"assige Einordnung als archaischer Homo sapiens, der in Ostafrika etwa bis ins fr\"uhe Oberpleistoz\"an existierte. Da sich eine Reihe primitiver Merkmale am Hirn- und Gesichtssch\"adel finden, die auch von anderen Vertretern des archaischen Homo sapiens bekannt sind, die zwischen 200 000 und 100 000 Jahren vor heute lebten, d\"urfte es wahrscheinlich sein, da\ss{} der neue Turkana-Fund auch in diesen Zeitraum datiert.},

Assemblages of single-platform cores excavated from extensive lateral exposures of the Okote Member provide insights into the relationship between raw-material availability and discard patterns. Variation in reduction intensity suggests that tools are not always discarded in patterns that would be predicted by the availability of raw material. Further, it appears that hominin transport decisions involved an assessment of the potential use-life of certain forms.

While these techniques provide new insights into artifact variation,   it is also necessary to insure that these methods provide data that is behaviorally   relevant. Here, we provide a new technique that includes three dimensional attributes   to calculate platform areas to enhance the prediction of flake area from platform   attributes. This data allows the calculation of more precise measures of reduction    in large unifacial flake cores in Developed Oldowan assemblages (i.e., Karari    Scrapers). Here, we look at measures of curation within these tool types across a    landscape scale study. We apply demographic analyses of the degree to which an    assemblage can be considered to be curated (i.e., the potential use life of a tool    minus the actual use life of a tool). Results suggest that even though there is significant    variation within a given paleogeographic setting, a higher frequency of pieces are    used to their full potential in areas where raw material is predicted to have been    scarce. These data suggest that hominins fulfill some aspects of a neutral model of    artifact transport, yet likely make directed movements to transport tools to specific    places on the ancient landscape.},

  abstract = {Until recently, the reproductive ecology of human males has not been extensively investigated, primarily as a result of the need for a theoretical framework based on the reproductive constraints and energetics of mammalian males. More specifically, male reproductive ecology has necessitated an integrative interpretation of clinical and anthropological data based on the premise that the evolution of human male life histories has involved selection for physiological mechanisms aimed at optimizing trade-offs between survivorship and reproductive effort. This paper attempts to address this gap in our understanding by presenting the current state of male reproductive ecology, including physiologic data from clinical and anthropological investigations as well as recent theoretical developments. Recent investigations outlining population variation in reproductive endocrine function are discussed within the context of potential sources of variation, including energetic expediture, caloric intake, and developmental canalization during adolescence. Additional summaries of male senescence and behavior are presented to provide a complete overview of male life history. Implications of recent anthropological data on contemporary health issues such as prostate cancer and the development of a male contraceptive are also discussed. Finally, several theories are presented that may contribute to our understanding of the evolution of male life histories and reproductive ecology, including theoretical suggestions involving the role of competition, mate choosiness, and potential constraints on male insemination ability, as well as a theory suggesting that male reproductive ecology may be best understood by analyzing energetic allocation decisions between differing somatic tissues that may be indicative of the competing needs for optimizing survivorship and reproductive effort.

Much of the data from these excavations remains unpublished and are accessible only through examination of field books and other field documentation held in Canterbury Museum. A review of this documentation was carried out in order to document the history of investigations at the site. A Geographic Information System (GIS) was used to manage the spatial data in order to create a plan locating many of the previous excavation units to a level of precision not previously attempted. Published material was drawn on, where necessary, to supplement the unpublished data. This analysis suggests that a minimum of 1687 m2 of the site has been investigated.},

However, these archaeological applications share a number of issues concerning 1) the role of archaeological data in networks; 2) the diversity of network structures, their consequences and their interpretation; 3) the critical use of quantitative tools; and 4) the influence of other disciplines, especially sociology. This article concerns a deconstruction of past archaeological methods for examining networks. Through a case study of Roman table wares in the eastern Mediterranean, the article highlights a number of issues with network analysis as a method for archaeology. It urges caution regarding the uncritical application of network analysis methods developed in other disciplines and applied to archaeology. However, it stresses the potential benefits of network analysis for the archaeological discipline and acknowledges the need for specifically archaeological network analysis, which should be based on relational thinking and can be expanded with an archaeological toolset for quantitative analysis.},

  abstract = {Archaeological network analysts often represent archaeological data as static networks and explore their structure. However, most networks changed through time and static network representations do not allow archaeologists to test assumptions about the dynamic processes driving this change. The study of visibility networks in archaeology is a good example of this. Archaeologists propose hypotheses of the role of lines of sight between settlements, which imply dynamic processes for the establishment of the observed visibility networks. However, commonly used methods do not allow us to evaluate these hypotheses. In this paper we introduce exponential random graph modelling (ERGM) as a method for bridging static and dynamic approaches to interpreting visibility networks. This method offers a number of advantages: (1) it explicitly addresses the assumptions inherent in visibility network creation about what relationships between nodes mean and the types of processes they allow for; (2) it allows one to investigate the range of network structures that these assumptions give rise to; and (3) it explores the dynamic processes that might have led to observed networks. This method is used to evaluate hypotheses of the role of lines of sight in facilitating visual control and communication during the later Iron Age in Southern Spain. This study shows that ERGMs can be used as a reflective technique to evaluate competing hypotheses, and that ERGM results subsequently require more contextualised evaluation. Future work on ERGMs should focus on incorporating geographical constraints to further enhance its potential for studying visibility networks.},

A brief discussion of graph theoretic applications in archaeology reveals how graph visualization and analysis was used since the 1960s in a very similar way to later network analysis applications, but did not seem to have influenced the more widespread adoption of network techniques over the past decade. These recent archaeological applications have been strongly influenced by two academic traditions, social network analysis and sociophysics. The most influential and promising techniques and models adopted from these traditions are critically discussed. This review reveals some general trends which are considered to be the result of two critical issues that will need to be addressed in future archaeological network analysis: (1) a general unawareness of the historicity and diversity of formal network methods both within and outside the archaeological discipline has resulted in a very limited methodological scope; (2) the adoption or development of network methods has very rarely been driven by specific archaeological research questions and is dominated by a few popular models and techniques, which has in some cases resulted in a routinized explanatory process. This review illustrates, however, the great potential of formal network methods for archaeology and argues that, if this potential is to be applied in a critical way, a broad multidisciplinary scope is necessary and specific archaeological research contexts should dominate applications.},

  abstract = {Long-term changes in visibility patterns between urban settlements are considered an important factor for understanding Iron Age II settlement locations in Southern Spain. From some settlements, the surrounding landscape and other settlements could be visually controlled, and some settlements are argued to be intervisible to allow for communication through visual signals. However, the study of how these visibility patterns changed in the subsequent Roman period in this region is largely ignored. In this paper, we argue that visibility might still have structured interactions between communities in Roman times and should not be dismissed out of hand merely because more and other data sources are available as compared to the Iron Age. However, the way in which it affected human behaviour might have been different in Roman times as compared to the Iron Age. We argue that simulating archaeologists' hypotheses about the emergence of inter-settlement visibility is a promising way of understanding such differences. To do this, we use exponential random graph modelling (ERGM), a statistical network simulation modelling technique that allows us to simulate hypotheses about the emergence and long-term change of visibility networks. We combine this approach with an exploratory analysis of the observed visibility networks between identified urban settlements, which will reveal similarities and differences in the changing patterns of visibility networks through time. The results of the ERGMs are then compared with the changes in the observed network structure. We conclude that our knowledge of the changes from the Iron Age II to the Roman settlement pattern suggests only gradual changes in the role of visibility in structuring inter-settlement interactions, possibly followed by a disintegration of the visibility network after the Roman Early Imperial period.},

Its underlying purpose is to analyze students' level of proficiency and appropriate understanding of angular measurement and associated measurement tools. It was hypothesized that eighth grade students would more accurately determine the measurement of a given angle to the nearest degree using visual estimation as opposed to using a protractor. The remainder of this study compares eighth grade students' assessments with university students' assessments. It was further hypothesized that neither age nor gender would influence a student's estimate despite the size or position of the angle. Subsequently, it was proposed that students, regardless of their age or gender, would have the most difficulty estimating acute angles within 10\textdegree{} of 0\textdegree{} and obtuse angles within 10\textdegree{} of 180\textdegree. The results of this study indicate that eighth grade students do not have sufficient knowledge in using angular measurement tools. Additional results revealed that both gender and age were found to have statistical significance in the visual estimation of angles and overwhelming evidence suggested that the least difficult angles to estimate were those close to 90 degrees.},

The number of occupied sites was low between 10,000 and 4500 BP, ranging between 1 to 4 per half-millennium. There were subsequent increases in the number of occupied sites per halfmillennium to 5\textendash 8 between 4500 and 2000 BP, 9\textendash 13 between 2000 and 1000 BP, and over 30 between 1000 and 0 BP. These figures would be consistent with a scenario of substantial population increases at around 4500, 2000 and 1000 BP. However, care should be exercised in making a literal interpretation of these figures. For instance, with respect to the 4500\textendash 2500 BP period, the number of closed sites was highest during 4500\textendash 3500 BP and the number of openair sites highest during 3500\textendash 2000 BP. Also, the large number of documented sites dating to the last millennium BP reflects a particular focus of Sulawesi archaeological research on sites related ethnohistorically to the Bugis and other major ethno-linguistic divisions in South Sulawesi.},

  abstract = {This research takes a multi-dimensional approach to the study of the archaeological record of Western Europe during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), combining two distinct components of the human adaptive system (technological organization and mobility) to test the impact of environmental variability on the mobility of Upper Palaeolithic groups. To this end we make use of two models. The first predicts landscape suitability as a function of a suite of environmental variables including topography, climate and inter-annual climate variability. The second model explores the link between patterns of mobility and technological organization, using lithic retouch frequencies as a proxy for mobility strategies. Combining detailed environmental and lithic data allows us to derive a clearer picture of human adaptation to environmental conditions during a particularly rigorous climatic interval in Western Europe. Our results show that while foragers generally favoured more suitable habitats, logistical mobility strategies were deployed across a wide spectrum of habitat suitability. Residential mobility strategies, on the other hand, tend to occur in relatively less suitable and thus inherently more variable habitats. We conclude that foragers made use of a predominantly logistic strategy during the LGM while adopting more residential strategies in response to local and relatively short-term fluctuations in the environment. The approach adopted here offers several promising avenues for future research on the ecology of human groups during the LGM. Copyright \# 2018 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

There has been a tremendous increase in the amount of molecular data available from birds, and more than two-thirds of these species have some sequence data available. Here we assembled these available sequence data from birds to estimate a large-scale avian phylogeny. We performed an unconstrained maximum likelihood analysis of a sparse supermatrix comprising 22 nuclear loci and seven mitochondrial regions from 6714 species. We inferred a phylogeny with a backbone remarkably similar to that obtained by detailed analyses of multigene datasets, yet with the addition of thousands of more taxa. All orders were monophyletic with generally high support. While most families and genera were well supported, a number of them, especially within the oscine passerines, had little or no support. This likely reflects problems with the circumscription of these genera and families. Our results indicate that the amount of sequence data currently available is sufficient to produce a robust estimate of the avian tree of life using current methods of inference. The availability of a tree that is unconstrained by prior information, with branch lengths that have a direct connection to the underlying data, should be useful for comparative methods, taxonomic revisions, and prioritizing taxa that should be targeted for additional data collection.},

We present and analyze a series of Fijian Plainware and Navatu phase AMS radiocarbon dates acquired from superimposed but stratigraphically separated occupation floors at the Sigatoka Sand Dunes site on the southwest coast of Viti Levu. Employing an OxCal Bayesian sequential model, we seek to date the temporal span for each occupation as well as the interval of time occurring between occupation floors. The latter is estimated to be 0\textendash 43 calendar years at 2s probability. The magnitude of ceramic and other differences between the Fijian Plainware and Navatu phase occupations at Sigatoka is substantive.

High precision U/Th dates of Acropora coral files (abraders) from Nukuleka give unprecedented resolution, identifying the founder event by 283868 BP and documenting site development over the ensuing 250 years. The potential for dating error due to post depositional diagenetic alteration of ancient corals at Nukuleka also is addressed through sample preparation protocols and paired dates on spatially separated samples for individual specimens.

Many animal species do have cultural traditions in the form of socially transmitted practices but they typically lack cumulative culture. Why is that? This discrepancy between humans and animals is even more puzzling if one realizes that culture seems highly advantageous. Thanks to their accumulated knowledge and techniques our early ancestors were able to leave their cradle in Africa and swarm out across the planet, thereby adjusting themselves to a whole range of new environments. Without culture this would have been impossible. So we may ask once again: if cumulative culture is so useful, why don\&rsquo;t other animals have it? In order to explain this mystery I won\&rsquo;t appeal to the major transitions in human evolution\&mdash;like walking upright, crafting stone tools and controlling fire, etc.\&mdash;because that would be question begging. Instead I try to unearth the mechanisms that caused those evolutionary turning points to occur in the first place. It seems that unlike other animals, humans are predisposed to efficiently acquire, store and transmit cultural information in such ways that our cultures can genuinely evolve.},

On the PSHK, we see migration at \textasciitilde 26,800, and likely again at \textasciitilde 13,000 cal bp. We offer an explanation for the Last Glacial Maximum origin of northeast Asian microblades that reconciles several major points of current competing theories. The later migration signals in both areas are weaker and associated with terminal Pleistocene (B\o lling-Aller\o d-Younger Dryas) environmental changes at the beginning of the Mesolithic Period in the Transbaikal and the Incipient-Jomon Period on PSHK. In the former, the second migration event may have been repopulation of an empty or sparsely inhabited area. In the latter, it appears to be population replacement when microblades completely disappear from the Peninsula without a reduction in the number of 14C dates.},

  abstract = {To explain social learning without invoking the cognitively complex concept of imitation, many learning mechanisms have been proposed. Borrowing an idea used routinely in cognitive psychology, we argue that most of these alternatives can be subsumed under a single process, priming, in which input increases the activation of stored internal representations. Imitation itself has generally been seen as a ``special faculty.'' This has diverted much research towards the all-or-none question of whether an animal can imitate, with disappointingly inconclusive results. In the great apes, however, voluntary, learned behaviour is organized hierarchically. This means that imitation can occur at various levels, of which we single out two clearly distinct ones: the ``action level,'' a rather detailed and linear specification of sequential acts, and the ``program level,'' a broader description of subroutine structure and the hierarchical layout of a behavioural ``program.'' Program level imitation is a high-level, constructive mechanism, adapted for the efficient learning of complex skills and thus not evident in the simple manipulations used to test for imitation in the laboratory. As examples, we describe the foodpreparation techniques of wild mountain gorillas and the imitative behaviour of orangutans undergoing ``rehabilitation'' to the wild. Representing and manipulating relations between objects seems to be one basic building block in their hierarchical programs. There is evidence that great apes suffer from a stricter capacity limit than humans in the hierarchical depth of planning. We re-interpret some chimpanzee behaviour previously described as ``emulation'' and suggest that all great apes may be able to imitate at the program level. Action level imitation is seldom observed in great ape skill learning, and may have a largely social role, even in humans.},

  abstract = {In the current literature, there are few experimental tests of capacities for cumulative cultural evolution in nonhuman species. There are even fewer examples of such tests in young children. This limited evidence is noteworthy given widespread interest in the apparent distinctiveness of human cumulative culture, and the potentially significant theoretical implications of identifying related capacities in nonhumans or very young children. We evaluate experimental methods upon which claims of capacities for cumulative culture, or lack thereof, have been based. Although some of the established methods (those simulating generational succession) have the potential to identify positive evidence that fulfills widely accepted definitions of cumulative culture, the implementation of these methods entails significant logistical challenges. This is particularly true for testing populations that are difficult to access in large numbers, or those not amenable to experimental control. This presents problems for generating evidence that would be sufficient to support claims of capacities for cumulative culture, and these problems are magnified for establishing convincing negative evidence. We discuss alternative approaches to assessing capacities for cumulative culture, which circumvent logistical problems associated with experimental designs involving chains of learners. By inferring the outcome of repeated transmission from the input\textendash output response patterns of individual subjects, sample size requirements can be massively reduced. Such methods could facilitate comparisons between populations, for example, different species, or children of a range of ages. We also detail limitations and challenges of this alternative approach, and discuss potential avenues for future research.},

Similarly, cultural evolution is observable in other species, but human cultural evolution appears strikingly distinct. This has led to speculation that the evolutionary origins of these capacities may be causally linked. Here we provide an overview of contrasting perspectives on the relationship between teaching and cultural evolution in humans, and briefly review previous research which suggests that cumulative culture (here meaning cultural evolution featuring a trend towards improving functionality) can occur without teaching. We then report the results of a novel experimental study in which we investigated how the benefits of teaching may depend on the complexity of the skill to be acquired. Participants were asked to tie knots of varying complexity. In our Teaching condition, opportunities to interact with an experienced partner aided transmission of the most complex knots, but not simpler equivalents, relative to exposure to completed products alone (End State Only condition), and also relative to information about the process of completion (Intermediate States condition). We conclude by considering the plausibility of various accounts of the evolutionary relationship between teaching and cultural evolution in humans.},

However, it is not clear whether primates follow a human's gaze to find hidden food under one of two containers in an object-choice task. In a series of experiments six adult female chimpanzees followed a human's gaze (head and eye direction) to a distal location in space above and behind them, and checked back to the human's face when they did not find anything interesting or unusual. This study also assessed whether these same subjects would also use the human's gaze in an object-choice task with three types of occluders: barriers, tubes, and bowls. Barriers and tubes permitted the experimenter to see their contents (i.e., food) whereas bowls did not. Chimpanzees used the human's gaze direction to choose the tube or barrier containing food but they did not use the human's gaze to decide between bowls. Our findings allowed us to discard both simple orientation and understanding seeing-knowing in others as the explanations for gaze following in chimpanzees. However, they did not allow us to conclusively choose between orientation combined with foraging tendencies and understanding seeing in others. One interesting possibility raised by these results is that studies in which the human cannot see the reward at the time of subject choice may potentially be underestimating chimpanzees' social knowledge.},

In contrast, this systematic study identified at least 12 distinct vitric tephras preserved in the Busidima Formation at Hadar (ca. 2.7\textendash 0.81 Ma), which are represented by no less than 20 chemical modes. These analyses are used to construct the first tephrostratigraphic-based sequence for the highly complex and discontinuous Busidima Formation deposits preserved at Hadar. Busidima Formation correlations have also been established between Hadar and neighboring project areas, specifically Dikika and Gona. Artifact Site Tuff 3 (AST-3), the Inaalale Tuff, and the Ken Di Tuff are correlated between Hadar and Dikika. AST-1, AST-3, the Ken Di Tuff, the Dahuli Tuff, and several localized tuffs of the Busidima Formation are correlated between Hadar and Gona. However, tuffs associated with the earliest archaeology in the two regions, namely AST-2 from Gona and BKT-3 from Hadar, were not identified outside their respective project areas. Nonetheless, the sequence of tephra provides important information for the placement and relationship of archaeological and paleontological sites both within Hadar and between Hadar and adjacent project areas.},

The study demonstrates LA-ICP-MS to be a highly accurate obsidian sourcing technique, with results that are directly comparable to instrumental neutron activation analysis. It documents a shift circa 600 B.C. in which Middle Formative villages in Tlaxcala began to obtain obsidian almost exclusively from sources located in the Mesa Central, when they had previously obtained approximately 50 percent from Mesa Central sources and 50 percent from sources located in the Sierra Madre Oriental. This shift broadly coincided with the development of large regional centers in Tlaxcala-Puebla and suggests a linkage between the local political evolution occurring at this time and increased interactions with the Mesa Central economic sphere, including the Basin of Mexico. Obsidian workshop dump deposits next to Teotihuacan's Moon Pyramid, dating to a millennium later, demonstrate the continued reliance on predominantly Mesa Central sources but also diversified procurement that drew on several sources. The Teotihuacan deposits exhibit the preferential utilization of particular sources depending on the types of implements being produced.

            Resumen
            Este informe presenta los resultados de un estudio utilizando ablaci\'on por l\'aser y espectrometr\'ia de masas con fuente de ionizaci\'on de plasma acoplado inductivamente (LA-ICP-MS) para examinar el aprovisionamiento de obsidiana en cuatro sitios del altiplano mexicano, datados entre los per\'iodos Formativo y Cl\'asico. Los an\'alisis con LA-ICP-MS demuestran que es una t\'ecnica altamente precisa para este tipo de estudios de obsidianas, cuyos resultados son directamente comparables con los de activaci\'on neutr\'onica. Este estudio indica un cambio en el sistema de obtenci\'on de obsidiana ca. 600 a.C., donde las aldeas del Formativo en Tlaxcala comienzan a obtener material casi exclusivamente de fuentes ubicadas en la Mesa Central. Anteriormente, lo hac\'ian en proporciones similares entre la Mesa Central (50 por ciento) y otras fuentes localizadas en la Sierra Madre Oriental (50 por ciento). Este cambio coincide ampliamente con el desarrollo de los grandes centros regionales en Tlaxcala-Puebla, y sugiere una conexi\'on entre la evoluci\'on pol\'itica local en esos momentos y un incremento en las interacciones con la esfera econ\'omica de la Mesa Central, incluyendo la Cuenca de M\'exico. Los talleres de obsidiana pr\'oximos a la Pir\'amide de la Luna de Teotihuacan, datados en el milenio siguiente, demuestran la continuidad en la dependencia predominante de las fuentes de la Mesa Central, pero tambi\'en el aprovisionamiento diversificado, empleando varias fuentes. Los dep\'ositos de Teotihuacan exhiben la utilizaci\'on preferencial de fuentes de aprovisionamiento particulares, dependiendo de los tipos de instrumentos que fueron fabricados.},

It was practiced during the Upper Paleolithic and Mesolithic (or Epipaleolithic) over vast portions of Europe, Asia, and Africa and it has also been ascribed to the Paleoindian Period for both Pre-Clovis and Clovis assemblages. However, the authors believe that in North America blade technology was relatively rare when compared to Old World settings and almost absent in some areas such as northeastern North America. Eastern Clovis lithic reduction systems supported a high degree of mobility, extremely low population densities, and an adaptation to a highly variable and changing Allered and Younger Dry as environment. At roughly the same time, Old World Upper Paleolithic and Epipaleolithic peoples used relatively structured and standardized blade/bladelet manufacturing systems that best suited higher population densities with lower levels of mobility. This paper examines the characteristics of these different lithic reduction strategies arid outlines the benefits of the bifacial core and tool technologies employed by early Paleoindians.},

  abstract = {Superimposed phases of stromatolite buildup are observed on the eastern margin of Lake Manyara and depict a paleoshoreline at about 20 m above modern lake level. Radiocarbon and Th/U measurements permitted the dating of the last two phases of stromatolite formation at ca. 90,000 yr and between 27,000 and 23,000 yr B.P., respectively. The Th/U chronology is based on the decay of a strong 230Th-excess (over 234U) inherited with the detrital particles cemented into the stromatolites. The various generations of stromatolites show comparable stable carbon and oxygen isotope contents and are located at the same paleolake stabilization levels. This indicates that stringent hydrological conditions are necessary for the development of the encrusting benthic microbial communities responsible for stromatolite formation. A comparison with similar stromatolitic units from the nearby Lake Natron-Lake Magadi basin shows that such conditions occurred during only a few of the late Quaternary humid episodes known in eastern Africa and that they are different in each basin. Stromatolites do not necessarily represent all high lake levels that Lake Manyara experienced during the late Pleistocene and Holocene.},

The early inhabitants of Eel Point depended heavily on sea-mammal hunting and shellfish collecting, rather than the intensive fishing that developed during the Late Holocene along the Southern California coast. Eel Point technological capabilities rivaled those of Late Holocene groups such as the Chumash Indians, including the ability to fabricate sophisticated watercraft. These data question traditional models of progressive maritime cultural development in coastal Southern California, and reveal the need for more empirical methods of assessing the seafaring capabilities of ancient maritime populations.

            Hacia los 8,000 a\~nos antes del presente, la cacer\'ia de mam\'iferos marinos y los viajes a mar abierto fueron establecidos en Eel Point(punta Anguila), Isla San Clemente, California.

Las capacidades tecnol\'ogicas en Eel Point rivalizaban con aqu\'ellas de grupos del Holoceno Tard\'io tales como los Indios Chumash, inclu\'ida la habilidad en la fabricaci\'on de embarcaciones sofisticadas. Mientras que tales embarcaciones y las econom\'ias intensivamente mar\'itimas han sido consideradas tradicionalmente como desarrollos propios del Holoceno Tard\'io, los datos en Eel Point subrrayan la importancia de comprender la navegaci\'on a lo largo del intervalo temporal completo del asentamientos prehist\'oricos costero.},

  abstract = {In humans, cultural transmission occurs usually by cumulative inheritance, generating complex adaptive behavioral features. Cumulative culture requires key psychological processes (fundamentally imitation and teaching) that are absent or impoverished in non-human primates. In this paper we analyze the role that teaching has played in human cumulative cultural evolution. We assume that a system of cumulative culture generates increasingly adaptive behaviors, that are also more complex and difficult to imitate. Our thesis is that, as cultural traits become more complex, cumulative cultural transmission requires teaching to ensure accurate transmission from one generation to the next. In an increasingly complex cultural environment, we consider that individuals commit errors in imitation. We develop a model of cumulative cultural evolution in a changing environment and show that these errors hamper the process of cultural accumulation. We also show that a system of teaching between parents and offspring that increases the fidelity of imitation unblocks the accumulation and becomes adaptive whenever the gain in fitness compensates the cost of teaching.},

  abstract = {Although the medical profession strives for equal treatment of all patients, disparities in health care are prevalent. Cultural stereotypes may not be consciously endorsed, but their mere existence influences how information about an individual is processed and leads to unintended biases in decision-making, so called ``implicit bias''. All of society is susceptible to these biases, including physicians. Research suggests that implicit bias may contribute to health care disparities by shaping physician behavior and producing differences in medical treatment along the lines of race, ethnicity, gender or other characteristics. We review the origins of implicit bias, cite research documenting the existence of implicit bias among physicians, and describe studies that demonstrate implicit bias in clinical decision-making. We then present the bias-reducing strategies of consciously taking patients' perspectives and intentionally focusing on individual patients' information apart from their social group. We conclude that the contribution of implicit bias to health care disparities could decrease if all physicians acknowledged their susceptibility to it, and deliberately practiced perspective-taking and individuation when providing patient care. We further conclude that increasing the number of African American/Black physicians could reduce the impact of implicit bias on health care disparities because they exhibit significantly less implicit race bias.},

  abstract = {In 1853, France annexed the Melanesian islands of New Caledonia to establish a convict colony and strategic port of call. Unlike other European settler\textendash dominated countries in the Pacific, the territory's indigenous people remained more numerous than immigrants for over a century. Despite military conquest, land dispossession, and epidemics, its thirty language groups survived on tribal reserves and nurtured customary traditions and identities. In addition, colonial segregation into the racial category of canaques helped them to find new unity. When neighboring anglophone colonies began to decolonize in the 1960s, France retained tight control of New Caledonia for its nickel reserves, reversing earlier policies that had granted greater autonomy for the islands. Anticolonial protest movements culminated in the 1980s Kanak revolt, after which two negotiated peace accords resulted in autonomy in a progressive form and officially recognized Kanak identity for the first time. But the near-parity of settlers and Kanak continues to make nation-building a challenging task, despite a 1998 agreement among Kanak and settlers to seek a ``common destiny.'' {$<$}br /{$><$}br /{$>$} This study examines the rise in New Caledonia of rival identity formations that became increasingly polarized in the 1970s and examines in particular the emergence of activist discourses in favor of Kanak cultural nationalism and land reform, multiracial progressive sovereignty, or a combination of both aspirations. Most studies of modern New Caledonia focus on the violent 1980s uprising, which left deep scars on local memories and identities. Yet the genesis of that rebellion began with a handful of university students who painted graffiti on public buildings in 1969, and such activists discussed many of the same issues that face the country's leadership today. After examining the historical, cultural, and intellectual background of that movement, this work draws on new research in public and private archives and interviews with participants to trace the rise of a nationalist movement that ultimately restored self-government and legalized indigenous aspirations for sovereignty in a local citizenship with its own symbols. Kanak now govern two out of three provinces and have an important voice in the Congress of New Caledonia, but they are a slight demographic minority. Their quest for nationhood must achieve consensus with the immigrant communities, much as the founders of the independence movement in the 1970s recommended.},

However, compared to many other large-scale Polynesian basalt sources, little has been published about the physical extent and geochemical variability of tool-quality basalt on Eiao; prior to our study, only a single site with evidence of stone extraction had been identified and geochemical information was limited to less than two dozen samples. In this paper we report geochemical data for 225 additional basalt specimens collected on Eiao. Our analyses were conducted non-destructively using three EDXRF instruments: one lab-based unit and two portable analysers. The majority of our sample, identified here as Group 1, possesses geochemical and physical characteristics similar to those reported in previous studies. Group 1 samples were collected from various locations on Eiao suggesting that, rather than being limited to a single quarry site, fine-grained basalt was extracted from multiple sources throughout the island. In addition, we identified a second group (Group 2), which possesses a distinct geochemistry, a coarser grain and often an unusual reddish colour. Evidence from Eiao indicates that Group 2 stone was regularly utilised and our analysis of an adze collected on Hiva Oa Island suggests that this material was distributed at least as far as the southern Marquesas.},

  abstract = {Spanning the period from w74\textendash 58 ka, and being broadly coeval with marine oxygen isotope stage 4 (MIS 4), the Still Bay and Howiesons Poort industries represent important phases in the development of the material culture of early modern humans. How and why these industries occurred when they did, however, remain matters for speculation. A key element of this debate has been the question of what role environmental change during the early stages of the last glacial period may have had on influencing human activity. Unfortunately, well-dated palaeoenvironmental evidence from this period is limited, and the debate has, out of necessity, been driven by the application of conceptual models of environmental change, many of which associate colder and warmer global climates with increased aridity and humidity respectively. In this paper, the regional marine and terrestrial evidence is synthesised to create an evidence-based palaeoenvironmental context. Based on the information available to date, it appears that rather than being characterised by dry conditions, MIS 4 was a period of relatively cool, moist climates, the ubiquity of which transcends the modern regional climate boundaries. It is suggested that orbital parameters at this time created greater interaction between tropical and temperate circulation systems, bringing more moisture to the subcontinent. These findings highlight the distinct nature of southern African climate systems, and caution against the application extra-regional conceptual models or inferring linear relationships with polar records.},

  abstract = {As in most regions of the Old World, Lower Paleolithic assemblages in the Indian subcontinent have been traditionally divided into biface (Acheulean) or nonbiface (core-and-flake) categories. Non-biface or Mode 1 assemblages have been reported from throughout the region, including the sub-Himalayan region or the Siwalik Hills as well as from various other eco-zones of India. This evidence has important implications for the understanding of diverse ecological and functional adaptations by South Asian hominin populations throughout the Pleistocene. This record comprises stratified and surface occurrences that include cores, core-tools, flakes and flake-tools, irregular bifacial knapping but a conspicuous absence of classic Acheulean bifaces and early Middle Paleolithic (diminutive) handaxes. Virtually all of these non-Acheulean assemblages currently remain undated, although a few occurrences in the Narmada Basin may date to the Mid-Pleistocene. From general geological observations and comparative typology, however, most appear to be comparatively younger in relative age and often mixed with different technological industries in surface contexts. This paper provides a broad regional perspective of these core-and-flake assemblages known from north-central and peninsular India.},

Applying appropriate measures results in more accurate data analysis. Notwithstanding, few comprehensive surveys on binary measures have been conducted.

  abstract = {The identification of prehistoric ethnic groups suffers from troubling epistemological difficulties. The assumption that archaeological cultures correspond perfectly with biological populations, languages, and ethnic groups is faulty because the amount of overlap between the elements of the `race-language-culture' triad must be determined empirically. The use of such overlap to identify prehistoric cultural groups is therefore highly suspect. Moreover, the study of ethnicity in sociocultural anthropology has demonstrated that it is a matter of self-identification at various social scales that does not necessarily correspond with any particular feature of material culture and is manipulated by individuals for social purposes. No cross-cultural regularities have been discovered that would enable the identification of ethnic groups in prehistory. Therefore, the study of ethnicity is impossible for most prehistoric contexts. However, in protohistoric and late prehistoric contexts, such as the Iroquoian Late Woodland period, ethnic attributions based on ethnohistoric and linguistic data may be possible by correlating historically known toponyms and ethnonyms with archaeologically known sites.},

Analyses of stratigraphy, radiocarbon dates, and paleoecological indicators (foraminifera, ostracods, molluscs, diatoms, silicoflagellates, and pollen) from core samples indicate that sea level rise caused the Ballona to shift from a bay at the mouth of the Los Angeles River to a lagoon by about 7500 cal BP. As the lagoon gradually filled with sediment, the landscape also changed, providing abundant resources for human exploitation from the middle Holocene to the early historic period. The archaeological record reveals that human settlement responded also to long-term climatic fluctuations and changes in the course of the Los Angeles River. Settlement was most widespread between 4000 and 1500 cal BP, when the wetlands were most productive. The inhabitants of the Ballona chose to abandon most of the area between 800 and 400 cal BP, when climatic conditions deteriorated rather than to intensify exploitation of nearby pelagic resources as some neighbouring populations did. People returned to the Ballona after 400 cal BP, when climatic conditions ameliorated, but with a markedly different settlement structure than before.},

Preliminary analysis indicates that these assemblages are dominated by Middle Stone Age (MSA) tools, coupled with an increasingfrequency of Later Stone Age (LSA) bladelet production, and are transitional between the MSA and the LSA. These assemblages are similar to the transitional assemblage identified at Sehonghong, and support the notion of a localised shift in lithic technology. The identification of a transitional assemblage which contains both MSA and LSA elements suggests that no cut and dried classification into MSA or LSA can be applied to all late Pleistocene assemblages and supportsa gradualist view of the MSA/LSAtransition in this region.},

  abstract = {The intellectual traditions that frame Paleolithic research in Europe and the United States are reviewed, and the European Middle Paleolithic archaeological record is examined for patterns that contradict the ``textbook generalizations'' embodied in Paul Mellars' ``human revolution''. The fact that different typologies are used to describe the Middle and Upper Paleolithic respectively emphasizes differences between them (especially if typology ``trumps'' any other systematic investigation of pattern), effectively precluding the perception of continuity in retouched stone tool form over the Middle-to-Upper Paleolithic transition. The proliferation of ``transition industries'' over the past 20 years has made the picture much more complicated than it was before ca. 1990, and the identification of ca. 20 Mousterian ``facies'' since 1985 strongly suggests that the west Eurasian Mousterian is more complex and variable than previously thought. We conclude that there is much under-acknowledged formal convergence in the kinds and frequencies of chipped stone artifacts, that patterns in lithic industries are mostly determined by raw material package size, quality and forager mobility, that changes in lithic technology are only ``historical'' at the macroscale (i.e., over evolutionary time), and that formal convergence likely overrides any ``cultural'' component supposedly present in the form of retouched stone tools.},

  abstract = {Published ages of {$>$}50 ka for occupation at Madjedbebe (Malakunanja II) in Australia's north have kept the site prominent in discussions about the colonisation of Sahul. The site also contains one of the largest stone artefact assemblages in Sahul for this early period. However, the stone artefacts and other important archaeological components of the site have never been described in detail, leading to persistent doubts about its stratigraphic integrity. We report on our analysis of the stone artefacts and faunal and other materials recovered during the 1989 excavations, as well as the stratigraphy and depositional history recorded by the original excavators. We demonstrate that the technology and raw materials of the early assemblage are distinctive from those in the overlying layers. Silcrete and quartzite artefacts are common in the early assemblage, which also includes edge-ground axe fragments and ground haematite. The lower flaked stone assemblage is distinctive, comprising a mix of long convergent flakes, some radial flakes with faceted platforms, and many small thin silcrete flakes that we interpret as thinning flakes. Residue and use-wear analysis indicate occasional grinding of haematite and woodworking, as well as frequent abrading of platform edges on thinning flakes. We conclude that previous claims of extensive displacement of artefacts and post-depositional disturbance may have been overstated. The stone artefacts and stratigraphic details support previous claims for human occupation 50 e60 ka and show that human occupation during this time differed from later periods. We discuss the implications of these new data for understanding the first human colonisation of Sahul.},

Despite the presence of more than two dozen adze quarries in Hawai'i, and previous attempts at replicating adze preforms and positing reduction sequences in Polynesia, there is no detailed study that clearly defines the steps and stages of quadrangular adze preform manufacture (the most common form in Hawai'i), and the resulting characteristic debitage. In this paper we examine the sequence of adze production for a population of 109 adzes from Moloka'i, documenting the transition from blanks to preforms to the finished objects that were transported away from quarries. Reduction intensity is measured using the Scar Density Index (Clarkson, 2013) calculated from 3D scans. We document the sequence of cumulative additions of characteristic features to adzes (e.g. bidirectional edges, bevel, poll and tang) as reduction intensity increases. We also note the reasons for adze rejection at each stage of reduction. Our study provides the first detailed analysis of adze reduction in Polynesia facilitated and standardised by 3D scanning technology. Hopefully, it will serve as a useful benchmark for objectively and systematically comparing adze technology in other parts of Hawai'i and across Polynesia, leading to a better understanding of regional and temporal variation in adze technology.},

taken by many to signify the physical presence of H. sapiens in western Eurasia. Following a brief summary of current
views of the archaeology of modern human origins, we outline the history of the Aurignacian since it was fi rst defi ned
by Lartet and Christy at the cave of Aurignac in the 1860s. For the Aurignacian to have heuristic validity, it must
share a number of defi ning characteristics that co-occur systematically across space and time. To test its compositional
integrity, we examine data from 52 levels identifi ed as Aurignacian by their excavators. Classical indicators of the French
Aurignacian are also reviewed and used to contextualize data from other regions, allowing us to assess whether or not
the Aurignacian can be considered a single, coherent archaeological entity. We conclude with some observations on the
nature of Paleolithic analytical units.},

Measurement of the activation energy is thus integral to the RHX methodology. In this paper, we report a temperature-step method for the measurement of activation energy and develop fully the underlying theoretical basis. In contrast to obtaining the activation energy from a series of separate experiments (each of which requires the sample to be dehydroxylated prior to measuring the RHX rate constant), the temperature-step method not only requires a single dehydroxylation at 500\textdegree C but also eliminates repeated acquisition of Stage I data, which are not required for dating purposes. Since the first temperature step is set to correspond to the temperature at which a dating determination is carried out, the measurement of rate constants at higher temperatures simply becomes an extension of dating. Consequently, the logistics of obtaining the activation energy of rehydroxylation are greatly simplified.},

This is a problematic approach to the archaeological and behavioural explanation of human migration. Here an evolutionary and ecological framework is developed to explain various movement behaviours and this framework is applied to the movement of human groups from the inter-visible islands around New Guinea to the widely dispersed archipelagos of the southwest Pacific about 1000 BC. Labelled the Lapita Migration, this movement is explained as a selection-driven range expansion. The development of evolutionary and ecological theory to explain human movement facilitates empirical testing of alternative hypotheses and links different histories of human movement through shared explanatory mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Postnatal growth is one of the proximate means by which humans attain massive adult brain size. Humans are characterized by the maintenance of prenatal brain growth rates into the first postnatal year, as well as an overall extended period of growth. The evolution of this pattern is difficult to assess due to its relatively brief duration and the underrepresentation of well-preserved fossil individuals who died during this short period. In this study, I use Monte Carlo methods to reconstruct postnatal brain growth rates in Australopithecus afarensis and Australopithecus africanus, based on estimates of neonatal brain size and of likely brain size and age at death of infant specimens (A.L. 333-105, DIK-1-1, and Taung). Neonatal brain size is reconstructed from the empirical scaling relationship among catarrhines which humans follow, and conservative estimates of fossils' chronological ages and brain sizes are drawn from the literature. Simulated distributions of these values are used to calculate average annual rates (ARs) of brain growth and proportional size change from birth (PSC), which are compared to resampled statistics from humans, chimpanzees and gorillas of known age and sex. Simulated ARs and PSCs for A. afarensis are significantly lower than those of chimpanzees and gorillas. Both ARs and PSCs for A. africanus are similar to chimpanzee and gorilla values. These results indicate that although these early hominins were derived in some aspects of brain anatomy, high rates of brain growth did not appear until later in human evolution. Moreover, findings also imply that brain growth rates are not a simple function of adult brain size. This study provides important new information about the evolution of brain growth, despite limitations inherent in fossil samples.},

Our analyses indicated that the toolkits of hunter\textendash gatherers are more affected by risk than are the toolkits of food producers. They also showed that the toolkits of food producers are more affected by population size than are the toolkits of hunter\textendash gatherers. This pattern is inconsistent with the predictions of both the risk hypothesis and the populationsize hypothesis. In contrast, it is consistent with the predictions of the niche construction hypothesis. Our results indicate that niche construction has affected the evolution of technology in small-scale societies and imply that niche construction must be taken into account when seeking to understand technological variation among food producers and the technological changes that occurred in association with the various transitions to farming that have occurred over the last 10,000 years.},

  abstract = {At various times in the past, the San Pedro Valley of southeastern Arizona was home to the ancestors of four contemporary American Indian tribes: Tohono O'odham, Hopi, Zuni, and Western Apache. Collaborative ethnohistoric research with these four tribes was conducted to explore multiple tribal histories drawing on concepts of cultural landscapes as memory. Members of each tribe use archaeological sites in the San Pedro Valley as monuments to substantiate their unique community history and worldview. A model of cultural landscapes encompassing variables of absolute, relative, and representational time and space was developed to enable us to better understand the interpretations of the past revealed by tribal research participants. American Indian concepts of landscape and history are brought into further focus through considerations of the ways in which archaeologists have appropriated ancestral sites for scientific inquiry. Differing conceptualizations of cultural landscapes in the San Pedro Valley are illustrated using the Reeve Ruin and Davis Ruin, occupied in the fourteenth century, as examples.},

  abstract = {The Near Eastern Middle Paleolithic is a technocomplex characterized by broad patterns in the succession of lithic industries through time, but also by significant technological diversity in some contexts. This chapter presents a geographic interpretation of such diversity based on comparison of the Umm el Tlel, Yabrud I and Ksar `Akil sequences. Within the paleoenvironmental mosaic of the Near East, each of these sites is located in a specific environment and allows us to address the question of technological change in different contexts. In these three sequences, in addition to a unique reduction system\textemdash Levallois\textemdash each industry shows evidence of different objectives and methods. Sites in the inland steppe region (Umm el Tlel and Yabrud I) show several technological changes through time, supporting significant technocultural variability for the populations occupying these sites. In contrast, little variation can be observed throughout the Ksar `Akil sequence. The progressive way in which change occurs suggests continuity of a single technological system, and the succession of populations sharing the same knowledge base. This chapter proposes that these different patterns of change through time are the expression of occupation patterns in different areas: a high degree of mobility for populations on the inland steppe region versus more limited territories in the coastal region, facilitating exchanges and communication between groups.},

The lithic pieces were found in an archaeological layer preserved at the bottom of the infilling of two karstic depressions on the Jurassic plateau. A large series of handaxes found during gravel quarrying in the Charente river valley and sparse assemblages from karstic cavities south of the large meander formed by the Charente river are amongst the main discoveries dating to the Lower Palaeolithic in Charente. In the Poitou region, Londigny is the first open air Lower Palaeolithic industry TL dated to MIS 11 recovered in a stratigraphic context. Only a handful of sites date to this period in North-West Europe. Our study of this assemblage however allows us to describe in detail the lithic production that is characteristic of the Acheulian technocomplex. Despite of the unusual use of small Jurassic flint nodules, both bifacial shaping and flake production highlight a technical package shared by most of the Acheulian industries at that time from North-West Europe to South-West France. The Londigny site, located in a position between north and south, extends the geographical range of the Acheulian in France.},

Through an agent-based simulation model, we test the null hypothesis and demonstrate that the drop in diversity exceeds that predicted by a drift process. We conclude by re-evaluating the possible adaptive changes underlying crop use in early Neolithic Europe.},

Quantitative analysis of the published records of over 400,000 animal bones recovered from 114 archaeological sites from SW Asia and SE Europe from c12 ka to c7.5 ka cal BP (thousands of calibrated radiocarbon years before present) demonstrates significant spatiotemporal variability in faunal exploitation patterns. Sites in the Euphrates region show adoption of domestic taxa by c10.5 ka cal BP, although on average these taxa contribute less than 10\% to total assemblage size. This rises to a median of about 40\% by c9.5 ka cal BP, and then to about 45\% of total NISP by c8.5 ka cal BP. By c10.5 ka in the Tigris and Zagros region domesticates contribute less than 5\% to faunal assemblages, but then rise to a median of about 20\% by c9.5 ka and 40\% by c8.4 ka cal BP. In contrast, Levantine sites have low numbers of domestic taxa ({$<$}1\%) until c8.8 ka cal BP, when the proportion dramatically increases to a median of about 35\%. This apparent delayed-adoption pattern also holds true for the southern Levant, which shows, on average, low levels ({$<$}1\%) of domestic taxa until 8.8 ka cal BP, at which point domesticates contribute a median of about 10\% to assemblages. In the northern parts of SW Asia, the mid- to late-10th millennium cal BP is pivotal, as proportions of domestic taxa show a dramatic increase in frequency during this time, and the `package' of domestic sheep, goat, cattle and pig becomes more firmly established. This sets the trend for sites of the 9th millennium and the appearance of Neolithic communities in SE Europe from the 8th millennium cal BP onwards, from which point domestic animals are ubiquitous in faunal assemblages.},

Here, we use genome-wide SNP data from the HapMap and CEPHHuman Genome Diversity Panel samples to study the geographic distributions of putatively selected alleles at a range of geographic scales. We find that the average allele frequency divergence is highly predictive of the most extreme FST values across the whole genome. On a broad scale, the geographic distribution of putatively selected alleles almost invariably conforms to population clusters identified using randomly chosen genetic markers. Given this structure, there are surprisingly few fixed or nearly fixed differences between human populations. Among the nearly fixed differences that do exist, nearly all are due to fixation events that occurred outside of Africa, and most appear in East Asia. These patterns suggest that selection is often weak enough that neutral processes\textemdash especially population history, migration, and drift\textemdash exert powerful influences over the fate and geographic distribution of selected alleles.},

The mechanics of flake formation are directly relevant to the identification of prehistoric flaking techniques and stone tool use. In this paper we provide a model of flake formation that accounts for much of the variation in flake morphology. Flakes can form in a number of ways and despite popular belief they are not all of the conchoidal variety. The bending flake is common in use wear though it is often misidentified as a conchoidal flake. A third major type of flake, the compression flake, is a common product of bipolar impact. To account for the wide variation in flake morphology we follow a tripartite scheme of flake formation comprising initiation, propagation, and termination phases, within which different mechanisms can operate.},

  abstract = {The Amakomanak site (AMR-00095), dated around 7500 BC, is located in the Noatak National Preserve in northwestern Alaska and presents an important microblade component (microblade cores, core tablets, and microblades) made of local chert. During the late Pleistocene and the early Holocene, microblade technology is widespread in central Alaska, dominated by Campus-s\- tyle microblade cores (wedge-shaped microblade cores). The Amakomanak assemblage is primarily composed of larger prismatic microblade cores, similar to assemblages from other northwestern Alaskan sites compared here. This paper argues that raw material available in each area may have played a major role in the different microblade core variants described. Indeed, raw material availability in the northwestern region could be one of the major reasons behind the production of larger prismatic cores, as opposed to central Alaska Campus-\-style cores usually made on smaller river cobbles. The paper also presents the results of a morphometric analysis of microblade cores and microblades from the Amakomanak site, comparing the data to both experimentally derived data sets on microblade-\-flaking modes, as well as other microblade assemblages in Alaska and Siberia.},

  abstract = {Understanding exchange is essential for understanding past societies. The exchange of knowledge and goods undeniably influenced the development of Pueblo culture. Previous studies within Southwestern archaeology have mostly focused on the exchange of material goods such as ceramics or prestige items since these items do not decay, while other day-to-day exchanges, such as the exchange of food items, are relatively undetectable in archaeology. Sahlins (1972) notes that in small-scale societies, food exchange is essential for the survival of individuals in patchy landscapes. Moreover, Sahlins's research shows that cross-culturally in small-scale societies, the exchange of food is one of the fundamental structuring mechanisms for alliances. With this knowledge, we may want to study the exchange of food within societies, but without being able to see the actual exchange, how can archaeologists explore the impact of food exchange given the relatively sparse archaeological record? In this paper, I use computer simulation to explore the extent to which food-sharing practices would have been instrumental for the survival of Ancestral Pueblo people across the patchy landscape of the Prehispanic American Southwest and suggest that we can see direct evidence of exchange through the aggregation of households into clustered settlements. Social networks would have created stable bonds among these exchanging individuals, further helping the survival of those individuals and their progeny. Specifically, I engage Sahlins's notion of balanced reciprocal exchange networks (BRN; when unrelated individuals rely upon reputation building to inform exchange relationships) within the experimental test-bed of the Village Ecodynamics Project's agent-based simulation.},

Other surface scatters have been identified during the 2013 and 2015 surveys, showing these two sites are not isolated in Al-Jawf, as rather important occurrences of Early Holocene technology have been identified across the region. Although the sites from Al-Jawf are surface occurrences and not radiometrically dated, the finds have proven to be extremely significant, representing a southward incursion of classic naviform cores-based technology, thus expanding the geographical distribution of this technology beyond the Levant.

  abstract = {Archaeological survey undertaken in central Saudi Arabia has revealed 29 surface sites attributed to the Arabian Middle Paleolithic based on the presence of Levallois blank production methods. Technological analyses on cores retrieved from AlKharj 22 have revealed specific reduction modalities used to produce flakes with predetermined shapes. The identified modalities, which are anchored within the greater Levallois concept of core convexity preparation and exploitation, correspond with those utilized during the Middle Stone Age Nubian Complex of northeast Africa and southern Arabia. The discovery of Nubian technology at the Al-Kharj 22 site represents the first appearance of this blank production method in central Arabia. Here we demonstrate how a rigorous use of technological and taxonomic analysis may enable intra-regional comparisons across the Arabian Peninsula. The discovery of Al-Kharj 22 increases the complexity of the Arabian Middle Paleolithic archaeological record and suggests new dynamics of population movements between the southern and central regions of the Peninsula. This study also addresses the dichotomy within Nubian core typology (Types 1 and 2), which was originally defined for African assemblages.},

  abstract = {Worldwide patterns of genetic variation are driven by human demographic history. Here, we test whether this demographic history has left similar signatures on phonemes\textemdash sound units that distinguish meaning between words in languages\textemdash to those it has left on genes. We analyze, jointly and in parallel, phoneme inventories from 2,082 worldwide languages and microsatellite polymorphisms from 246 worldwide populations. On a global scale, both genetic distance and phonemic distance between populations are significantly correlated with geographic distance. Geographically close language pairs share significantly more phonemes than distant language pairs, whether or not the languages are closely related. The regional geographic axes of greatest phonemic differentiation correspond to axes of genetic differentiation, suggesting that there is a relationship between human dispersal and linguistic variation. However, the geographic distribution of phoneme inventory sizes does not follow the predictions of a serial founder effect during human expansion out of Africa. Furthermore, although geographically isolated populations lose genetic diversity via genetic drift, phonemes are not subject to drift in the same way: within a given geographic radius, languages that are relatively isolated exhibit more variance in number of phonemes than languages with many neighbors. This finding suggests that relatively isolated languages are more susceptible to phonemic change than languages with many neighbors. Within a language family, phoneme evolution along genetic, geographic, or cognate-based linguistic trees predicts similar ancestral phoneme states to those predicted from ancient sources. More genetic sampling could further elucidate the relative roles of vertical and horizontal transmission in phoneme evolution.},

Many of the first quantitative models of cultural evolution were modified from existing concepts in theoretical population genetics because cultural evolution has many parallels with, as well as clear differences from, genetic evolution. Furthermore, cultural and genetic evolution can interact with one another and influence both transmission and selection. This interaction requires theoretical treatments of gene\textendash culture coevolution and dual inheritance, in addition to purely cultural evolution. In addition, cultural evolutionary theory is a natural component of studies in demography, human ecology, and many other disciplines. Here, we review the core concepts in cultural evolutionary theory as they pertain to the extension of biology through culture, focusing on cultural evolutionary applications in population genetics, ecology, and demography. For each of these disciplines, we review the theoretical literature and highlight relevant empirical studies. We also discuss the societal implications of the study of cultural evolution and of the interactions of humans with one another and with their environment.},

It is based on the assumption that the dependent variable is beta-distributed and that its mean is related to a set of regressors through a linear predictor with unknown coefficients and a link function. The model also includes a precision parameter which may be constant or depend on a (potentially different) set of regressors through a link function as well. This approach naturally incorporates features such as heteroskedasticity or skewness which are commonly observed in data taking values in the standard unit interval, such as rates or proportions. This paper describes the betareg package which provides the class of beta regressions in the R system for statistical computing. The underlying theory is briefly outlined, the implementation discussed and illustrated in various replication exercises.},

Given that childhood is argued to be the time when other-regarding preferences and egalitarianism develop, it is critical to evaluate how the development of food sharing may influence prosociality. In this chapter, the social processes of learning to share food among Hadza hunter-gatherer children are explored. I combine naturalistic observations of food sharing, experimental data on other-regarding preferences, and ethnographic interview data to determine processes of cultural transmission. The results suggest that Hadza children routinely share food with both related and unrelated partners, although preferentially share with kin. They exhibit many processes of social learning, including observation, imitation, participation, reinforcement, play, and teaching. These data support recent suggestions that prosociality and egalitarianism develop strongly during middle childhood when children acquire the normative rules of their society.},

Instead, it appears that these artifacts represent deliberate polyhedral sha This theory is explored using data from both the cores and the polyhedrons to demonstrate initially that they represent two separate li types, and then to discuss the implications of the differences. Finally, this paper offers some theories on the function of the polyhedro whether they were bead blanks, tokens, or gaming pieces.},

  abstract = {We propose that the cognitive mechanisms that enable the transmission of cultural knowledge by communication between individuals constitute a system of `natural pedagogy' in humans, and represent an evolutionary adaptation along the hominin lineage. We discuss three kinds of arguments that support this hypothesis. First, natural pedagogy is likely to be human-specific: while social learning and communication are both widespread in non-human animals, we know of no example of social learning by communication in any other species apart from humans. Second, natural pedagogy is universal: despite the huge variability in child-rearing practices, all human cultures rely on communication to transmit to novices a variety of different types of cultural knowledge, including information about artefact kinds, conventional behaviours, arbitrary referential symbols, cognitively opaque skills and know-how embedded in means-end actions. Third, the data available on early hominin technological culture are more compatible with the assumption that natural pedagogy was an independently selected adaptive cognitive system than considering it as a by-product of some other human-specific adaptation, such as language. By providing a qualitatively new type of social learning mechanism, natural pedagogy is not only the product but also one of the sources of the rich cultural heritage of our species.},

Here we describe the statistical parameters of the facies using a large data set comprising 54 collections from 20 sites assigned by the excavators to one or another of the facies. A statistical summary revealed many cross-cutting patterns that departed from qualitative descriptions of the facies, calling their compositional integrity into question. A multivariate discriminant analysis helped resolve some of these problems. It confirmed a strong statistical affinity between the B and C facies, which were in turn sharply differentiated from D. Our results are then compared with the stratified Mousterian sequence at Hummal, a site in the Syrian Desert. Relatively good correspondence was attained. Implications of the analysis are discussed in terms of the adequacy of the systematics used to identify facies differences and what they might mean behaviorally.},

Results over the last decade show that some defining features of human language can arise under these experimental conditions, which use iteration to simulate processes of cultural transmission. The form modalities used in iterated learning studies have expanded considerably in recent years, but the dynamics of how learning a completely novel form system interact with processes of cultural transmission are only beginning to be explored. This paper provides a brief overview of artificial language learning studies in the context of language evolution, situating them in a framework which focuses on forms used in learning and production. This issue is further explored with an iterated experiment which focuses on the role of learning completely novel forms in isolation. This experiment uses a new set of graphical symbols called Ferros, which are produced using a virtual palette. Results show that properties of this novel form space\textemdash in particular, ease of articulation\textemdash have specific effects on sequence learning and evolution. These results have implications for how forms and modalities might constrain language systems, and demonstrate how the use of truly novel alien forms might be extended to address new questions in cultural and linguistic evolution.},

Michael Behe argued that mouse traps cannot trap mice with any part missing; therefore, they cannot have a precursor with one part less, therefore, cannot have a continuous history, and therefore, cannot have evolved. The patented and seminal precursor of current flat snap traps, however, had one part less, because spring and striker were formed of one wire. Secondly, historical records that reach back into the Bronze Age suggest that its history continued for a very long time. Thirdly, all prerequisites for evolution (variation, transmission, and selection) abound in mouse trap populations. Hence, Behe's triple-jump conclusion about mouse traps is false each step. There is no, in principle, impossibility for mouse traps to evolve. An evolutionary account of mouse trap history also has academic merits beyond its educational value. Three important conclusions can be drawn: (1) reticulate phylogenies of artifact systems may be resolvable as overlapping, but branching, phylogenies of parts; (2) homologous ideas may be realized by analogous material, that is, phylogenies of information do not necessarily coincide with those of material parts; (3) recombination of parts between different artifact systems increases the cumulative nature of cultural evolution.},

It is important to note that further investigation of Chia Sabz will certainly provide more secure information about how and when the Epipaleolithic transition to the Neolithic started in the region. This paper will present the recent excavations at the site, and then, based on the 14C dates, will discuss the site's importance in western Iran.},

  abstract = {The prehistory of Cape York Peninsula, in tropical northern Australia, has been more intensively investigated than that of most other parts of the continent. As a result, a considerable database now exists by which long-term archaeological trends can be evaluated. In this paper we investigate temporal trends in occupational intensities and patterns of land use during the last 37,000 years by employing: 1, the temporal distribution of all radiocarbon dates obtained for the region; 2, the numbers of sites occupied through time; and 3, rates of establishment of new sites during the course of prehistory. These archaeological trends are then compared with the palaeo-environmental record of the region to determine its potential influence on the trends. We conclude that an initial, long period of regional occupation occurred (c. 37,000\textendash 4000 BP) when cultural trends varied in tandem with gross environmental fluctuations. This was followed by a late Holocene period (post 4000 BP) when cultural trajectories diverged significantly from environmental trends. This suggests that more complex Aboriginal demographic processes were set in train during the late Holocene, associated with social structures that were more dynamic than previously. We suggest that while changing patterns of land use may be apparent, their understanding requires an enquiry into periods of emergence \textemdash{} that is, their immediate historical antecedents. These results have broader implications for our understanding of Australian prehistory and the prehistory of other hunter-gatherer societies.},

At that time Neoglacial conditions brought seasonal pack ice to the eastern Aleutians as well as many of the same marine mammals hunted earlier by ASTt peoples farther north. The ASTt's highly adaptable subsistence technology worked well in the eastern Aleutians where the rich Neoglacial environment provided the basis for relatively permanent settlement and population growth. Accumulating evidence points to an expansion of eastern Aleutian populations during the Neoglacial, and significant contacts with arctic peoples across vast distances of the American Arctic. Rather than an isolated archipelago, the Aleutians were a corridor for a surprisingly free flow of people, ideas, and materials.},

This period, sees more sustained occupation and evidence of new technologies, including bone and wooden tools, hunting and fire-use. Importantly, brain size had begun to approach modern capacity. The fine-tuned record from Britain enables correlation of sites and new models of human behaviour to be developed. Millennial-scale changes in material culture can now be recognised, which can be interpreted as brief incursions by different cultural groups into Britain from mainland Europe. We suggest that population movement was primarily driven by changes in climate and environment. We further propose that variation in material culture is a reflection of local resources and landscape and that during stable environment localised expressions of culture emerge. This can be applied to Europe, where it is suggested that a complex mosaic of small-scale cultural groupings can be identified, some with and some without handaxes, but underpinned by a common set of technologies and behaviours.},

  abstract = {Since lithic tools are intended to accomplish certain functions as a response to environmental demands, their original design changes considerably during use. Thus, exploring variability on the original designs can be informative of cultural adaptive processes on past populations. However, the complex life-cycle of a stone tool includes loops of damage due to use followed by breakage and resharpening that dramatically blur the size and shape attributes defining the original design. Here we use the Factor Model, a statistical approach recently modified to be used in landmark data, to evaluate original design attributes versus changes attributed to maintenance activities on a sample of Southern Patagonia lithic stemmed points, including arrows and spears. The model enables the separation of shape aspects that tend to covary because of common factors affecting simultaneously the two fundamental modules of a classical stemmed weapon (blade/stem), from those shape features explained only by local factors affecting modules independently. Our results show that original design differences explain most of the total shape variation, and also indicate that maintenance patterns differ among point types considered as different weapon systems (arrows and spears). Whereas arrow reduction is focused on tip modifications, spears present a broader array of shape changes including the tip and the shoulders. These results demonstrate that disentangling the sophisticated interaction among original design and maintenance activities of lithic projectile points enables a proper and independent exploration of adaptation to functional demands and cognitive models of past populations.},

Our aim is to test the hypothesis of a possible relationship between this species and the European Middle and early Late Pleistocene hominins, the so-called Neanderthal lineage. Some cranial, postcranial, and dental features are plesiomorphic for the genus Homo and thus, they are not useful for our purpose. Other morphologies are derived with regard to H. ergaster/H. erectus, and TD6 hominins share those traits with modern humans, with Neanderthals or with both lineages. In this context we hypothesize either that there exists a phylogenetic continuity between Homo antecessor and Neanderthals or that both species shared a common ancestor.},

  abstract = {Quebrada Tacahuay, located on the south coast of Peru, is one of the oldest expressions of maritime adaptations in the Western Hemisphere. Excavations conducted in 1997 and 1998 indicate that humans focused their activities on the collection and butchering of marine birds, particularly cormorants and boobies, and other marine resources more than 10,290 years ago (uncalibrated radiocarbon years B. P.). In addition to abundant zooarchaeological remains, cultural material includes unifacial lithic tools and one worked marine mammal rib. We report on the use of marine resources at the site in conjunction with the taphonomic history of site formation. Geological data indicate that El Ni\~no flood events initially occurred during the Pleistocene and at various times during the Holocence. The abundant use of seafood indicates that Quebrada Tacahuay represents a specialized coastal extraction station used by Late Paleo-Indian populations with a well-developed littoral adaptation.

Resumen
La Quebrada Tacahuay, situada en la costa del sur de Per\'u, es un sitio arqueol\'ogico de varios componentes caracterizado por una ocupaci\'on humana profundamente cubierta por diferentes estratos geol\'ogicos, y que data del Pleistoceno Tard\'io/Holoceno Temprano. El sitio es uno de los m\'as antiguos con una econom\'ia mar\'itima en el hemisferio occidental, el cual ten\'ia como base la caza y procesamiento de aves marinas, y el uso limitado de otros recursos mar\'itimos. Las ocupaci\'ones subsiguientes presentan evidencias de una ampliaci\'on de la dieta que incluye una variedad de mariscos y pescado. El sitio fue identificado por los arque\'ologos del proyecto durante una prospecci\'on geol\'ogica de la regi\'on costera en 1996. Cortes paralelos de una carretera y un proyecto hidr\'aulico asociados con la construcci\'on de la carretera Ilo - Ite, a mediados de 1990, dejaban expuestos las capas de la ocupaci\'on del sitio. Varios metros de sobrecarga asociados con el fen\'omeno del Ni\~no cubren el dep\'osito arqueol\'ogico. Las excavaciones en 1997 y 1998 han determinado el \'area del sitio y se han identificado tres fogones, de los cuales se recuperaron una gran cantidad de restos zooarqueol\'ogicos y arqueobot\'anicos. Todo el material del sitio fue cernido usando una zaranda de 1/16" (1.8mm) para asegurar la recuperaci\'on de restos peque\~nos. Los artefactos recuperados consisten en nueve herramientas l\'iticas y m\'as de 900 fragmentos de deshecho l\'itico, incluso lascas utilizadas, retocadas, y astilladas. El \'unico artefacto no l\'itico es un peque\~no elemento rectangular, trabajado y pulido, que posiblemente sea una costilla de un mam\'ifero marino. La mayor parte de los materiales arqueol\'ogicos de ambas temporadas es zooarqueol\'ogica. La mayor\'ia de los elementos son de guanay o pajarobobo, aunque se presentan algunos elementos de pel\'icano. Tambi\'en, algunos elementos muestran huellas de cortes. Nuestra interpretaci\'on propone que el sitio fue un lugar especializado para la recolecci\'on y el procesamiento de aves marinas, con el uso menor de mam\'iferos, pescado, y mariscos. La ocupaci\'on fue cubierta inicialmente por una inundaci\'on del fen\'omeno del Ni\~no, y posteriormente sucesivas inundaciones cubrieron la ocupaci\'on con una capa de sedimentos de aproximadamente dos metros de grosor. La excelente preservaci\'on de las materias zooarqueol\'ogicas puede ser atribu\'ida a este hecho.},

For the Middle Paleolithic, the best documented are the Levallois debitage system, the laminar production system, the discoidal debitage system, and the Quina debitage system. Their geographical and chronological distributions show some general trends: a greater diversity of the production systems coexisting within the same region (especially in Southwestern France) at the end of the Middle Paleolithic; an increased use of the systems characterized by a low degree of blank predetermination (Quina and discoidal systems, Levallois recurrent centripetal method), and the emergence of a flexible, multifunctional toolkit with a high curation potential. These changes can be attributed to groups with different technical traditions who kept their own fundamental technical identity but who also adopted similar mobility patterns during the unstable climatic period at the end of the Middle Paleolithic, resulting in shared forms of socioeconomic behavior (frequent population moves and increased residential mobility).},

  abstract = {The recovery at Shi'bat Dihya 1 (SD1) of a dense Middle Paleolithic human occupation dated to 55 ka BP sheds new light on the role of the Arabian Peninsula at the time of the alleged expansion of modern humans out of Africa. SD1 is part of a complex of Middle Paleolithic sites cut by the Wadi Surdud and interstratified within an alluvial sedimentary basin in the foothills that connect the Yemeni highlands with the Tihama coastal plain. A number of environmental proxies indicate arid conditions throughout a sequence that extends between 63 and 42 ka BP. The lithic industry is geared toward the production of a variety of end products: blades, pointed blades, pointed flakes and Levallois-like flakes with long unmodified cutting edges, made from locally available rhyolite. The occasional exploitation of other local raw materials, that fulfill distinct complementary needs, highlights the multi-functional nature of the occupation. The slightly younger Shi'bat Dihya 2 (SD2) site is characterized by a less elaborate production of flakes, together with some elements (blades and pointed flakes) similar to those found at SD1, and may indicate a cultural continuity between the two sites. The technological behaviors of the SD1 toolmakers present similarities with those documented from a number of nearly contemporaneous assemblages from southern Arabia, the Levant, the Horn of Africa and North Africa. However, they do not directly conform to any of the techno-complexes typical of the late Middle Paleolithic or late Middle Stone Age from these regions. This period would have witnessed the development of local Middle Paleolithic traditions in the Arabian Peninsula, which suggests more complex settlement dynamics and possible population interactions than commonly inferred by the current models of modern human expansion out of Africa.},

  abstract = {We evaluate the cultural variation between the youngest Howiesons Poort layer (GR) and the oldest post-Howiesons Poort layers (RB-YA) of Sibudu Cave (KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa). We first conducted a technological analysis, secondly we performed a cladistic study with all the technological traits and, finally, we compare the technological variability with other data from Sibudu (ochre, micromorphology, fauna and plant remains). The synapomorphies of the cladistical analysis show numerous lithic technological changes between the youngest Howiesons Poort and the oldest post-Howiesons Poort layers as previously concluded. However, some technological strategies that are present, yet uncommon, in the Howiesons Poort become abundant in the overlying layers, whereas others that were fundamental to the Howiesons Poort continue, but are poorly represented in the overlying layers. We further show that lithic technological strategies appear and disappear as pulses in the post-Howiesons Poort layers studied. Among the most notable changes in the post-Howiesons Poort layers is the importance of flake production from discoidal knapping methods, the unstandardized retouched pieces and their infrequent representation, and the higher than usual frequency of grindstones. We evaluate various hypotheses to explain the transformation of a Howiesons Poort formal industry to a more `expedient' assemblage. Since no marked environmental changes are contemporary with the technological transformation, a change in residential mobility patterns seems a plausible explanation. This hypothesis is supported by the changes observed in stratigraphy, lithic technology, site management, ochre and firewood collection.},

This paper reports on the technology of the recently excavated stone tool collection, over 18,000 pieces. Our results indicate that reduction sequences were generally short, flaking productivity was low, and knapping methods were largely simple and expedient, lacking the technical skills observed in other Oldowan assemblages. Conspicuous differences are observed in the cha\^ines ope ratoires of the three main raw materials used at HWK EE: the quartzite reduction sequence can be reconstructed in full at the site, most of the lava detached pieces are missing, and there is a preferential use of chert for retouched tools. This portrays a composite picture, where knapping expediency and low productivity are accompanied by raw material selectivity and consistent presence of retouched artefacts. Coexistence of these features in the same assemblage leads us to question the monolithic structure of the Oldowan techno-complex, and highlights the kaleidoscopic nature of technological strategies at Olduvai immediately before the earliest Acheulean handaxes appear in the sequence.},

Our study focuses on the main site (T2-Main Trench) and adjacent trenches (T12 and T9), which constitute the bulk of the archaeological assemblage recently excavated in the EF-HR area (de la Torre et al., 2018a). Site formation processes are investigated through taphonomic proxies and spatial analysis, and consider artifact features, orientation patterns, and topographic data retrieved during archaeological excavation. This enables an assessment of the impact of natural agents on the assemblage and a discussion of the relevance of water disturbance in shaping the structure of the EF-HR archaeological record. Our results indicate that fluvial action over the assemblage was significant, although it is likely that EF-HR still preserves areas marginally affected by water sorting and rearrangement. In summary, by applying a novel approach that combines a systematic analysis of artifact attributes with GIS spatial analysis of archaeological remains and topographic features, our study aims to provide a fresh look at the interaction of human and natural agents in the formation of Early Stone Age assemblages at Olduvai Gorge.},

  abstract = {Technological strategies of early humans are discussed in the light of a recently excavated stone tool assemblage from EF-HR, an archaeological site older than 1.33 Ma at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania. Renewed fieldwork at EF-HR has unearthed a lithic collection containing over 2300 artefacts (including a hundred handaxes in stratigraphic position), which represents one of the largest assemblages for the early Acheulean in eastern Africa. Our technological study shows co-occurrence of two distinctive reduction sequences in the same assemblage, one aimed at obtaining small flakes and the other focused on the production of large, thick, heavy flakes that were then used as blanks for handaxe shaping. Flaking of small cores is expedient and low intensity, and knapping methods are similar to those observed in earlier Oldowan assemblages. Large Cutting Tools (LCTs) show no evidence of planform and biconvex symmetry, and shaping sequences are brief and discontinuous, indicating short use-lives for handaxes. Bifaces are rare and atypical. Recurrent morphotypes are knives, which are poorly-shaped, scraper-like, large-sized handaxes. Despite the apparent expediency of EF-HR handaxe production, a closer inspection of the interplay between debitage and fa\c{c}onnage stages reveals remarkably standardized procedural patterns. Large Cutting Tool blanks were produced following fixed knapping rules resulting in flakes with a specific morphology and mass distribution. Adapted to the idiosyncrasies of each blank, shaping was almost invariably imposed over the same areas in all LCTs and sought to produce morphotypes that, technologically, are remarkably identical to each other. This strongly supports the existence of mental templates and technical rules that were systematically practiced in LCT production at EF-HR, and underscore the structured nature of technological behaviour at the onset of the Acheulean in eastern Africa.},

Descriptions of geomorphology, stratigraphy, and archaeological \textquestiondown nds are given, along with an analysis of reduction and secondary trimming techniques and retouch typology. Single-platform mono-frontal \`Aat cores, double-platform bi-longitudinal cores, orthogonal cores, and narrow-front cores dominate the reduction strategy. Microcores are also present. Levallois-like cores appear initially in Horizon 2.7. Within the tool assemblage, retouched blades, end-scrapers on blades, notched-denticulate tools and large side-scrapers (skreblos) were identi\textquestiondown ed. There are also various micro-tools present, including bladelets with blunt edges, oblique points, and truncated tools. The lithic industries of Horizons 3\textendash 2.5 are classi\textquestiondown ed as Early Upper Paleolithic; a conclusion supported by radiocarbon determinations (ca. 30,000 BP). The lithic complexes described here are broadly analogous with other known Early Upper Paleolithic sites both in Mongolia (e.g., Chikhen-Agui; Orkhon-1 and -7; Tolbor-4, -15, and -16), and within a larger territory including the Russian Trans-Baikal region, North China, and the Altai Mountains. Archaeological materials from the lowermost strata at Chikhen-2 are important because they illustrate the emergence of the Upper Paleolithic in southern Mongolia.},

Recent years have seen a proliferation of empirical and theoretical work exploring the interplay between demography and CCE. This has generated intense discussion about whether demographic models can help explain historical patterns of cultural changes. Here, we synthesize empirical and theoretical studies from multiple fields to highlight how both population size and structure can shape the pool of cultural information that individuals can build upon to innovate, present the potential pathways through which humans' unique social structure might promote CCE, and discuss whether humans' social networks might partly result from selection pressures linked to our extensive reliance on culturally accumulated knowledge.},

The presence of the Acheulean culture in the coastal regions constitutes a particular scientific interest in learning more about the expansion of this culture in North Africa, and in studying the adaptation of the Acheulean group to the Mediterranean ecology. The archeological surveys and the systematic excavations carried out since 2001 have brought to light a continuous sequence of Acheulean stratigraphy at Errayeh, comprising four distinct archaeological levels. The preliminary data authenticate that this site represents the oldest Acheulean occupation in the Mediterranean coastline of Algeria. The excavations have revealed a rich and diversified lithic material made up of not only diagnosis elements of the Acheulean like for instance hand axes, cleavers, trihedral picks and large fragments, but also nuclei, varied fragments and touched up pieces. The preliminary study of the lithic Acheulean assembly pieces collected from the various levels of occupation are evidence of a great technological variability. The characterization of this variability is based on the production systems for each archaeological level. The analysis of the morphological and technical characters seeks primarily at defining the techniques of cutting up and shaping of the bifacial and nonbifacial tools. This approach also takes into account the diversity and the nature of materials used by the Acheuleans.},

For more than five years, Palaeoeskimo lithic technology in Nunavik (Eastern Arctic) was examined following this concept, which integrated the entire artifact story from raw material procurement to final discard of tools, offering many behavioral insights. The application of the French analytical methodology to Dorset collections provided relevant results, as illustrated in this contribution dealing with micro blade production. Through this analysis, we explain how the constraints linked to raw material availability and the Arctic environment in particular stimulated an important behavioral adaptation, evidenced by this lithic technology. The subsequent question of whether this adaptiveflexibility would complicate recognition of patterned cultural behavior is also addressed.},

  month = jan,
  abstract = {In this example we will detect the change point in a time series of counts using Bayesian methodology. A natural solution to this problem utilizes a Gibbs sampler. We'll first implement the sampler in R naively, then create a vectorized R implementation, and lastly create an implementation of the sampler using Rcpp and RcppArmadillo. We will compare these implementations using a famous coal mining data set. We will see that the speed of the sampler greatly improves with each implementation.  We will assume that we have a time series of n responses coming from a Poisson distribution. The first k observations are i.i.d. and come from a Poisson distribution with mean lambda, while the remaining observations are i.i.d. and come from a Poisson distribution with mean phi. We will assume the prior distribution for lambda is Gamma(a, b), the prior distribution for phi is Gamma(c, d), and the prior distribution for k is discrete uniform over the values 1,2,\ldots,n. From this information, one can arrive at closed form expressions for the full conditional distribution of lambda, phi, and k (see here).  We can sample values from the full conditional distributions of lambda and phi using the rgamma function built into R. We can sample from the discrete set of values 1, 2, \ldots, n using the sample function with the appropriate sampling probability for each value. Since the probability mass function (pmf) for the full conditional distribution of k is a bit complicated, we'll code it up as its own function taking the observed data y and the parameters lambda and phi. The functions for the pmf will be named kprob*. Note that in the pmf we will need to calculate the natural logarithm of a sum of exponential values; this can sometimes create problems with numerical underflow or overflow. Consequently, we will also create a function logsumexp to do this efficiently. The Gibbs samplers for the three implementations will be named gibbsloop, gibbsvec, and gibbscpp.  The initial naive R implementation of the sampler is given below. \# Function for Gibbs sampler.  Takes the number of simulations desired, \# the vector of observed data, the values of the hyperparameters, the  \# possible values of k, a starting value for phi, and a starting \# value for k.  \# Function takes: \# nsim: number of cycles to run \# y: vector of observed values \# a, b: parameters for prior distribution of lambda \# c, d: parameters for prior distribution of phi \# kposs: possible values of k \# phi, k: starting values of chain for phi and k  gibbsloop},

Its Mousterian industry, as later described by Skinner, has been thought to be characteristic of other Mousterian industries from that region, what is generally called the Zagros Group Mousterian. The present analysis shows that the Bisitun industry contains some important features that were overlooked by Skinner, including a high frequency of Levallois technique and several truncated-faceted pieces. Because these features have not yet been recognized in other Zagros Mousterian industries, their presence here raises the question of the distinctiveness and homogeneity of this Mousterian Group.

  abstract = {A new interpretation of early stone-tool use by hominins at Olduvai depicts them as involved in battering activities (using pounding tools) rather than making cutting butchering tools as is commonly inferred in most other Plio-Pleistocene sites where lithics appear associated to faunal remains. The bulk of this interpretation is based on the recognition of the stigma of percussion activities in anvils and detached byproducts. Renewed excavations at BK after more than half a century of the beginning of the digging at the site by M. Leakey have produced a new and unbiased lithic assemblage. The taphonomic study of the faunal assemblage has shown that BK is an anthropogenic site where carcass butchery practices were repeatedly performed over a vast amount of time. The present analysis of the lithic artefacts supports this interpretation by showing that the obtainment of flakes was the principal aim in stone knapping. We argue that a number of technical traits observed in the lithic collection of BK can be best interpreted as the result of bipolar loading rather than the by-products of battering activities. Since BK has provided the second largest collection of hominid-modified bones from Olduvai, it is concluded that detached pieces produced in the course of bipolar reduction might have played an active role in bone modification and that active rather than passive percussion behaviors might have been responsible for the formation of the lithic assemblage. The functionality of the Oldowan stone tools are discussed under the light of the new study.},

There have been, however, recent criticisms and discussions on the statistical performance of the Mantel test. Simultaneously, alternative frameworks for data analyses are being proposed. Here, we review the Mantel test and its variations, including Mantel correlograms and partial correlations and regressions. For illustrative purposes, we studied spatial genetic divergence among 25 populations of Dipteryx alata (``Baru''), a tree species endemic to the Cerrado, the Brazilian savannas, based on 8 microsatellite loci. We also applied alternative methods to analyze spatial patterns in this dataset, especially a multivariate generalization of Spatial Eigenfunction Analysis based on redundancy analysis. The different approaches resulted in similar estimates of the magnitude of spatial structure in the genetic data. Furthermore, the results were expected based on previous knowledge of the ecological and evolutionary processes underlying genetic variation in this species. Our review shows that a careful application and interpretation of Mantel tests, especially Mantel correlograms, can overcome some potential statistical problems and provide a simple and useful tool for multivariate analysis of spatial patterns of genetic divergence.},

  abstract = {Several questions remain regarding the timing and nature of the Neanderthal-anatomically modern human (AMH) transition in Europe. The situation in Eastern Europe is generally less clear due to the relatively few sites and a dearth of reliable radiocarbon dates. Claims have been made for both notably early AMH and notably late Neanderthal presence, as well as for early AMH (Aurignacian) dispersal into the region from Central/Western Europe. The Kostenki-Borshchevo complex (European Russia) of Early Upper Paleolithic (EUP) sites offers high-quality data to address these questions. Here we revise the chronology and cultural status of the key sites of Kostenki 17 and Kostenki 14. The Kostenki 17/II lithic assemblage shares important features with Proto-Aurignacian material, strengthening an association with AMHs. New radiocarbon dates for Kostenki 17/II of \textasciitilde 41e40 ka cal BP agree with new dates for the recently excavated Kostenki 14/IVw, which shows some similarities to Kostenki 17/II. Dates of  41 ka cal BP from other Kostenki sites cannot be linked to diagnostic archaeological material, and therefore cannot be argued to date AMH occupation. Kostenki 14's Layer in Volcanic Ash assemblage, on the other hand, compares to Early Aurignacian material. New radiocarbon dates targeting diagnostic lithics date to 39 e37 ka cal BP. Overall, Kostenki's early EUP is in good agreement with the archaeological record further west. Our results are therefore consistent with models predicting interregional penecontemporaneity of diagnostic EUP assemblages. Most importantly, our work highlights ongoing challenges for reliably radiocarbon dating the period. Dates for Kostenki 14 agreed with the samples' chronostratigraphic positions, but standard pre-treatment methods consistently produced incorrect ages for Kostenki 17/II. Extraction of hydroxyproline from bone collagen using preparative high-performance liquid chromatography, however, yielded results consistent with the samples' chronostratigraphic position and with the layer's archaeological contents. This suggests that for some sites compound-specific techniques are required to build reliable radiocarbon chronologies.},

  abstract = {Several questions remain regarding the timing and nature of the Neanderthal-anatomically modern human (AMH) transition in Europe. The situation in Eastern Europe is generally less clear due to the relatively few sites and a dearth of reliable radiocarbon dates. Claims have been made for both notably early AMH and notably late Neanderthal presence, as well as for early AMH (Aurignacian) dispersal into the region from Central/Western Europe. The Kostenki-Borshchevo complex (European Russia) of Early Upper Paleolithic (EUP) sites offers high-quality data to address these questions. Here we revise the chronology and cultural status of the key sites of Kostenki 17 and Kostenki 14. The Kostenki 17/II lithic assemblage shares important features with Proto-Aurignacian material, strengthening an association with AMHs. New radiocarbon dates for Kostenki 17/II of \textasciitilde 41e40 ka cal BP agree with new dates for the recently excavated Kostenki 14/IVw, which shows some similarities to Kostenki 17/II. Dates of  41 ka cal BP from other Kostenki sites cannot be linked to diagnostic archaeological material, and therefore cannot be argued to date AMH occupation. Kostenki 14's Layer in Volcanic Ash assemblage, on the other hand, compares to Early Aurignacian material. New radiocarbon dates targeting diagnostic lithics date to 39 e37 ka cal BP. Overall, Kostenki's early EUP is in good agreement with the archaeological record further west. Our results are therefore consistent with models predicting interregional penecontemporaneity of diagnostic EUP assemblages. Most importantly, our work highlights ongoing challenges for reliably radiocarbon dating the period. Dates for Kostenki 14 agreed with the samples' chronostratigraphic positions, but standard pre-treatment methods consistently produced incorrect ages for Kostenki 17/II. Extraction of hydroxyproline from bone collagen using preparative high-performance liquid chromatography, however, yielded results consistent with the samples' chronostratigraphic position and with the layer's archaeological contents. This suggests that for some sites compound-specific techniques are required to build reliable radiocarbon chronologies.},

  abstract = {Research indicates that children in small-scale cultures acquire many subsistence skills and knowledge relatively easily and quickly at an early age. However, the precise age and the developmental sequence of acquiring skills and knowledge are seldom described. Considerable debate also exists as to the importance of particular modes (e.g., vertical, horizontal, and oblique) and processes (e.g., role of teaching) of cultural transmission. This chapter examines some of these debates by focusing on how Chabu hunter-gatherer adolescents learn to spear hunt. Informal and structured interviews and systematic behavioral observations (focal follows) were utilized to try and understand when and how adolescent males learned to spear hunt. Data indicate that Chabu adolescents start learning to spear hunt in middle childhood (6\textendash 7 years of age) through play hunting (i.e., role-playing and collaborative learning) with their peers and listening to stories from their fathers. Adolescents learned the various skills and knowledge of spear hunting at different ages from multiple people, and they preferred to go on actual hunts with knowledgeable people and close friends. The data provide some support for model-based selective trust hypotheses. Oblique modes of cultural transmission were more common than vertical and horizontal forms of transmission during the acquistion of adolescent spear hunting and data from focal follows revealed that various forms of teaching were important to learning how to spear hunt.},

The dynamic nature of stone-tool production/exchange/use systems can be understood through a technological analysis of producer site assemblages and a functional and technological examination of consumer sites. Chipped-stone assemblages from the producer site of Colh\'a, Belize, and the consumer site of Santa Rita Corozal, Belize, indicate opposing but interdependent roles within the same exchange system. Preclassic formal tools such as the oval biface and stemmed macroblade were manufactured at workshops in Colh\'a and exhibit a high degree of specialization and standardization in manufacture. These formal tools were then exchanged beyond the chert-bearing zone of northern Belize to consumer sites such as Santa Rita. Once these formal tools entered the consumption sphere they were used, broken, discarded, or recycled into a variety of second-order expedient tools.

This experimental setting permitted the investigation of more fundamental aspects of stone technology, including the effect of particular platform attributes, core surface morphology, and the application of force on flake size and shape. These experiments used cores made of glass that were molded to exact configurations. Here we set out to investigate whether results obtained from experiments on glass cores can be extended to other materials, in this case varieties of basalt, flint, and obsidian that were cut to the exact core configurations. We focused on the relationships between the independent variables of exterior platform angle and platform depth and dependent variables of overall size (weight or mass), volume, and linear dimensions. It was found that in almost every comparison, all four materials show similar relationships in nature and degree. What differs instead is the amount of force needed to detach a flake. In other words, given the same core morphology and platform attributes the resulting flakes will be the same, but harder materials require more force to remove the flake. These results were additionally verified on Middle Paleolithic archeological materials made mostly on Late Cretaceous flints. Our results demonstrate that experiments using glass cores are valid and can be generalized and extended to other materials.},

These paradigm-changing discoveries require solid, unambiguous evidence. Here, we adopt a hypothesis-testing scientific approach in which we show that neither of these discoveries, as reported, has provided compelling evidence of these behaviors in the Pliocene. We do not reject the hypothesis of stone tool use and butchery in the Pliocene. We do however stress that the evidence presented in both cases remains disputable and the inferences drawn from it are not secure. We argue that the hypotheses of non-hominin agency for the Dikika bones and the ex situ nature of the Lomekwi assemblage (probably involving a palimpsest of accumulations) have not been discarded.},

  abstract = {The recognition of intentional heat treatment of stone artifacts in the archaeological record has been a major research topic since the initial study by Crabtree and Butler (1964). Ethnographic and archaeological records reveal two methods of intentional thermal alteration: controlled heat treatment most commonly used to enhance the flaking quality of stone, and thermal shock fracturing often applied to produce angular facets on rounded nodules of tough lithologies. During controlled heat treatment , the stone was heated slowly and evenly to the temperature needed to bring about the desiredflaking properties, which become more like those of high quality lithologies like obsidian. The response of a lithology to heat treatment is variable, and the same improvements in flaking properties can be accomplished by a variety of heating and cooling rates, provided the heating/cooling is not too rapid and a maximum temperature (350-400 \textdegree C for cherts) is not exceeded. The improved workability makes soft hammer and pressure flaking more efficient, allowing greater conservation of raw material and manufacture of extensively retouched tools. Controlled thermal alteration was normally applied to microcrystalline silicious materials; it began in the Middle Palaeolithic (around 110,000 - 90,000 B.P.) and was widespread around the world, but in most areas it became obsolete in the Early Bronze Age.},

In contrast with OGS 7, the better preservation of the bone assemblage at A.L. 894 allows the identification of taphonomic processes of bone breakage, thanks to abundant green bone fractures. The presence of tooth marks and the lack of hominin-produced bone modifications together argue against hominins as the responsible agents for bone accumulation and modification. This taphonomic study of A.L. 894 shows lack of evidence for functional associations between stone tools and bones, a pattern documented in several other early Pleistocene sites. Such a pattern underscores the complex phenomena involved in site formation processes, especially in the earliest archaeological assemblages \'O 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Recent research indicates that both Upper Paleolithic humans and Middle Paleolithic (MP) Neanderthals exploited the Zayukovo obsidian and transported it to distances in order 250 km from the source. However, only in 2016 the first stratified MP site (Saradj-Chuko Grotto) was found in the region. Preliminary results of the 2017 multi-disciplinary research suggest that the grotto was occupied by Neanderthals likely during a warm period of MIS 5. The Neanderthals used this cave as an active habitation site for consumption of ungulates, which they hunted, and production of tools from obsidian. Saradj-Chuko Grotto has yielded the first MP industry in the Northern Caucasus, in which obsidian artefacts absolutely prevail. The technical-typological peculiarities allow us to define the industry initially as the laminar Mousterian, which differs from the Eastern Micoquian industry widespread in the north-western Caucasus, that recall early MP artefacts from Weasel Cave located further east at the border with north-eastern Caucasus, MP sites in the Southern Caucasus and Zagros Mousterian in the Lesser Caucasus. Saradj-Chuko Grotto has a great potential to provide prominent results that illuminate culture-technological variability, differences of subsistence, and characteristics of obsidian exchange among MP Neanderthal groups in the Caucasus and the broader region.},

This paper examines faunal and floral records from the archaeological site at Tunnel Cave, Leeuwin\textendash Naturaliste Region, southwestern Australia, which are relevant to the Mid-Holocene local extinction of Blackflanked Rock-wallaby (Petrogale lateralis). Possible factors causing the population decline include inter-species competition, over-hunting by humans or other predators, or vegetation habitat change caused by climate change or changes in human firing practices. Identification of macroscopic charcoal excavated at Tunnel Cave shows that changes in canopy trees began from 10,000 BP, consistent with post-glacial rainfall increases, and probably causing the encroachment of closed habitats and loss of grazing areas. These changes are consistent with other faunal shifts at Tunnel Cave and with faunal and identified charcoal records from the nearby Devil's Lair deposit. There is little evidence for changes in competitor or predator behaviour, although increasing geographic isolation of Petrogale habitats possibly exacerbated predator impacts. The timing of human occupations at Tunnel Cave in relation to vegetation change suggests that human firing was a minor influence on forest composition or structure. Petrogale's Mid-Holocene disappearance from the region is therefore attributable to climatically driven encroachment of closed habitat.},

Otto Meyer (1877\textendash 1937), a Sacred Heart Missionary stationed on Watom Island, described chance finds of `prehistoric pottery' in 1909, following these with more systematic excavations. Patrick O'Reilly (1900\textendash 88), a Marist Father associated with the Mus\'ee de l'Homme in Paris, drew on Meyer's work, his own extensive bibliographical knowledge and his observations during a one-year mission in the region in 1934\textendash 5 to present part of the collection in France, laying the ground for further theories. The publication, interpretation and curation of the Meyer/O'Reilly collection represents an exemplary journey through the history of Pacific archaeology and the emergence of the Lapita paradigm. We consider the context of Meyer's encounter with O'Reilly, the ideas both men advanced in analysing the collection and the site, and how these resonated during the development of Pacific and Lapita archaeology throughout the first half of the 20th century.},

As such, the ability to gauge the use-lives of artifacts is important for understanding the formation of archaeological assemblage variability. In lithic artifacts, use-life can be expressed as the extraction of utility, or work potential, from existing stone volume. Using experimental data and generalized linear modeling, this study develops models of artifact use-life on cores in the form of reduction intensity. We then apply these models to two archaeological case studies to (a) reconstruct the reduction intensities of archaeological cores and (b) investigate the survivorship curves of these archaeological cores across the reduction continuum using the Weibull function. Results indicate variation in core reduction and maintenance with respect to raw material properties and place use history and implicate evolutionary differences between Early Stone Age hominins and Holocene modern humans.},

Most subsequent research on North African prehistory refers to his discoveries and interpretations, but the chronology of its archaeological and geological sequences has been based on very early age determinations. This paper reports on the initial results of a comprehensive multi-method dating program undertaken as part of new work at the site, involving radiocarbon dating of charcoal, land snails and marine shell, cryptotephra investigations, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of sediments, and electron spin resonance (ESR) dating of tooth enamel. The dating samples were collected from the newly exposed and cleaned faces of the upper 7.5 m of the w14.0 m-deep McBurney trench, which contain six of the seven major cultural phases that he identified. Despite problems of sediment transport and reworking, using a Bayesian statistical model the new dating program establishes a robust framework for the five major lithostratigraphic units identified in the stratigraphic succession, and for the major cultural units. The age of two anatomically modern human mandibles found by McBurney in Layer XXXIII near the base of his Levalloiso-Mousterian phase can now be estimated to between 73 and 65 ka (thousands of years ago) at the 95.4\% confidence level, within Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 4. McBurney's Layer XXV, associated with Upper Palaeolithic Dabban blade industries, has a clear stratigraphic relationship with Campanian Ignimbrite tephra. Microlithic Oranian technologies developed following the climax of the Last Glacial Maximum and the more microlithic Capsian in the Younger Dryas. Neolithic pottery and perhaps domestic livestock were used in the cave from the mid Holocene but there is no certain evidence for plant cultivation until the Graeco-Roman period.},

Its fundamental structure is shown to be stylistic; this characteristic, coupled with historical factors, is seen as the major reason why evolutionary processes have not been extensively employed in explaining cultural change. Consideration of an evolutionary approach suggests that such processes as natural selection have considerable explanatory potential, but it is also suggested that a substantial segment of the archaeological record is not best understood in terms of adaptation. The potential of an evolutionary approach cannot be realized without making a fundamental distinction between functions, accountable in terms of evolutionary processes, and style, accountable in terms of stochastic processes.},

Recently, Heyes and colleagues have proposed explicit (or Type 2) metacognition as a key feature of human cognition that might enable cumulative culture. In the current review we examine these arguments, and consider their plausibility. Firstly we consider whether distinctions between cognitive processes described as explicit/implicit, and Type 1/2 (or Systems 1/2), do indeed capture features that distinguish processes specific to human cognition, versus those that are shared with other species. In particular we consider whether this applies to distinctions relating to metacognitive processes. We also consider the ways in which explicit metacognitive processing might plausibly facilitate cumulative culture. We categorise the potential benefits as either optimising receiver behaviour, or optimising sender behaviour. Within both of these categories benefits could arise as a consequence of more effective representation of either one's own knowledge state, or that of others. We evaluate the current state of evidence supporting each of these potential benefits. We conclude by proposing methodological approaches that could be used to directly test the theory, and also identify which (if any) of the possible causal mechanisms may be implicated.},

  abstract = {While the anatomy and physiology of human reproduction differ between the sexes, the effects of hormones on skeletal growth do not. Human bone growth depends on estrogen. Greater estrogen produced by ovaries causes bones in female bodies to fuse before males' resulting in sex differences in adult height and mass. Female pelves expand more than males' due to estrogen and relaxin produced and employed by the tissues of the pelvic region and potentially also due to greater internal space occupied by female gonads and genitals. Evolutionary explanations for skeletal sex differences (aka sexual dimorphism) that focus too narrowly on big competitive men and broad birthing women must account for the adaptive biology of skeletal growth and its dependence on the developmental physiology of reproduction. In this case, dichotomizing evolution into proximate-ultimate categories may be impeding the progress of human evolutionary science, as well as enabling the popular misunderstanding and abuse of it.},

It was drawn by Tupaia, an arioi priest, chiefly advisor and master navigator from Ra`i\=atea in the Leeward Society Islands in collaboration with various members of the crew of James Cook's Endeavour, in two distinct moments of mapmaking and three draft stages between August 1769 and February 1770. To this day, the identity of many islands on the chart, and the logic of their arrangement have posed a riddle to researchers. Drawing in part on archival material hitherto overlooked, in this long essay we propose a new understanding of the chart's cartographic logic, offer a detailed reconstruction of its genesis, and thus for the first time present a comprehensive reading of Tupaia's Map. The chart not only underscores the extent and mastery of Polynesian navigation, it is also a remarkable feat of translation between two very different wayfinding systems and their respective representational models.},

The discipline has well established and tested methods to track change through time and to evaluate the function of artifacts that depend upon measures of variation in the archaeological record. Although a critical concept, the means by which variation in material culture is generated is not well understood. This paper explores one source of variation, copying errors, and systematically examines how cultural transmission processes act to amplify, reduce, or maintain such variation. Using simple models, we generate expected distributions for the amount of variation that occurs through time under varying circumstances. This variation is caused by small errors that are transmitted from one person to another in the propagation and replication of cultural traits. These baseline values provide useful null models for explaining variation in prehistoric assemblages of artifacts. We use measurements of projectile points from Owens Valley and Woodland ceramics from Illinois to demonstrate the value of this approach.},

Sedentism is often part of a suite of cultural changes, often accompanied by seed intensification, storage, population increase, environmental degradation, establishment of social hierarchy, and agriculture. Most models describe these changes as a series of events, with one precipitating the next. As a result, sedentism is interpreted as either a direct byproduct or a causative trigger of other societal changes. Results of excavations at the village site of Sunga'va (CA-INY-3806) are used to examine the timing of sedentism in relation to the development of storage and seed intensification in the Owens Valley of California. The site, which has evidence for two separate occupations from a period that has heretofore not been the subject of intensive research, suggests that sedentism developed at the same time or just before storage and some 800 years before seed intensification. Data do not support social models, such as the activity of aggrandizers or the stabilization of longdistance exchange networks, in these developments.},

  abstract = {The study of artifact standardization is an important line of archaeological inquiry that continues to be plagued by the lack of an independent scale that would indicate what a highly variable or highly standardized assemblage should look like. Related to this problem is the absence of a robust statistical technique for comparing variation between different kinds of assemblages. This paper addresses these issues. The Weber fraction for line-length estimation describes the minimum difference that humans can perceive through unaided visual inspection. This value is used to derive a constant for the coefficient of variation (CV = 1.7 percent) that represents the highest degree of standardization attainable through manual human production of artifacts. Random data are used to define a second constant for the coefficient of variation that represents variation expected when production is random (CV = 57.7 percent). These two constants can be used to assess the degree of standardization in artifact assemblages regardless of kind. Our analysis further demonstrates that CV is an excellent measure of standardization and provides a robust statistical technique for comparing standardization in samples of artifacts.

            R\'esum\'e
            El estudio de estandarizaci\'on y variaci\'on ha sido una importante y valiosa linea de inter\'es en los an\'alisis arqueol\'ogicos. Sin embargo, a\'un persisten dos problemas que son el enfoque de este estudio. En primer lugar, faltan medidas independientes para evaluar problemas de estandarizaci\'on y variaci\'on. En otros t\'ermines, no hay nada que indica c\'omo se debe hacer una muestra arqueol\'ogica bien estandardizada \cyrchar\cyro{} bien variable. En segundo lugar, no existe una t\'ecnica estadistica segura para hacer comparaciones cuantitativas. El 'Weberfraction,' utilizado para la estimaci\'on de una l\'inea amplia describe la diferencia m\'inima que seres humanos pueden percibir con solo una inspecci\'on ocular. Este valor es utilizado para derivar una constante (CV = 1.7percent) que repr\'esenta la variaci\'on minima obtenida a trav\'es de la producci\'on manual de artefactos por seres humanos. Datas aleatorios son utilizados para determinar una segunda constante que repr\'esenta la variaci\'on esperada bajo condiciones aleato-rias (CV = 57.7 percent). De este modo, estas dos constantes pueden estar utilizadas para determinar el grado de estandarizaci\'on en las colecciones de artefactos. Tambi\'en, este estudio proporciona una t\'ecnica estadistica segura para compararla estandarizaci\'on en muestras de artefactos.},

However, our ability to infer past human migration events, especially those that occurred over rapid timescales, is often limited. A key example is the peopling of Polynesia, where the timing is relatively well defined, but the exact routes taken during the final stages and the source populations are not. Here, we discuss the technical limitations of current methods for inferring rapid human migration events, using the final stages of Polynesian migration as an example. We also introduce a promising new proxy method to infer human migrations\textemdash patterns of bacterial evolution within ancient dental calculus (calcified plaque). While we focus on Polynesia, this method should be applicable to other past migrations, enhancing our understanding of human prehistory and revealing the crucial events that shaped it.},

This is a synthetic analysis of the Western Mediterranean area where sites featuring broad stratigraphic sequences are abundant and enable an adequate assessment of the available record. Presenting all the data organized according to geographical regions contributed to the homogeneity of the results and allowed us to contextualize a regional synthesis, from a broad territorial and chronological point of view. This perspective was compared to other distant European spheres which in turn enabled establishing a framework that consolidates the study area as a different cluster, independent from the remainder of the territories. This paper shows how the various Neanderthal populations had diverse cultural traditions throughout Europe; these are reflected by the archaeological record with the existence of diverse regional clusters that show a significant variability during the Middle Palaeolithic. Therefore it seems reasonable to conclude that even though the previously referred technical traditions persisted throughout the entire Middle Palaeolithic, arguably even more so than during more recent time periods, it seems pretty obvious that the idea of the Middle Palaeolithic being an homogenous period is wrong and should be disregarded as far as Europe and the Western Mediterranean in particular are concerned.},

Until now, attention has been primarily focused on the site's fossil hominins and evidence for symbolic behavior in the form of burials and rare artifacts such as pierced shells and pigment objects. We present here the results of renewed analysis of the lithic artifacts from Skhul drawn from archival collections in the United States, United Kingdom, and Israel. Although lithic artifacts form the majority of the archaeological record from the site, they have rarely been the subject of comprehensive study. Our analyses of raw material selection, use and transport combined with technological analyses of artifact production methods (1) indicate selective transport to the site of large flakes, retouched pieces, and particularly Levallois points from non-local sources, and (2) demonstrate substantial variability in raw material procurement that fails to indicate clear differences in landscape use between H. sapiens and Neanderthals.},

These two instances and others in the Great Lakes area are good evidence of the symbolic values attached to these artifacts by their makers. While we cannot be certain of their precise meaning, one very plausible explanation might lie in the fact that as people advanced into uninhabited regions, creating such caches of useful items made of exotic raw materials were one way to imbue the landscape with cultural, historic and sacred meanings.},

Currently, four distinct chronologies for the timing of population divergence are available, ranging from the late Middle Pleistocene to the late Early Pleistocene, each based on different interpretations of hominin taxonomy. Genetic data can present an independent estimate of the evolutionary timescale involved, making it possible to distinguish between these competing models of hominin evolution. We analysed five dated Neanderthal mitochondrial genomes, together with those of 54 modern humans, and inferred a genetic chronology using multiple age calibrations. Our mean date estimates are consistent with a process of genetic divergence within an ancestral population, commencing approximately 410e440 ka. These results suggest that a reappraisal of key elements in the Pleistocene hominin fossil record may now be required.},

As one application of our framework, we study the evolution of cultural diversity (in time as well as between groups).},

We conducted a controlled experiment to determine whether a knapper's growing replication skills would be hindered if the toolstone used was switched from large flakes of an easily worked chert to nodules of less tractable one. Two batches of Preferential Levallois cores were knapped, an earlier series made from standardised large flakes of sediments dominated by chalcedonic quartz followed by a more challenging one using variably-shaped, cortical nodules of microcrystaline quartz that varies in the completeness of quartz replacement of calcite and dolomite. Skill level markers were designed to measure the knapper's ability to achieve a series of set goals. These were quantified and subjected to statistical testing. In all but one test, significant increases in skill could be detected from the earlier to the later batch of reductions, despite the drop in toolstone quality. Significant improvements in the consistency of the knapper's output could also be detected. However, the switch to a more challenging, nodular chert did require extra shaping, which resulted in more waste. This masked visible progress towards producing a less costly core. Overall, our results do not support the assumed primacy of toolstone constraints over other factors in influencing the morphology of flaked stone tools.},

  abstract = {Background: Middle Palaeolithic stone artefacts referred to as `Levallois' have caused considerable debate regarding issues of technological predetermination, cognition and linguistic capacities in extinct hominins. Their association with both Neanderthals and early modern humans has, in particular, fuelled such debate. Yet, controversy exists regarding the extent of `predetermination' and `standardization' in so-called `preferential Levallois flakes' (PLFs).
Methodology/Principal Findings: Using an experimental and morphometric approach, we assess the degree of standardization in PLFs compared to the flakes produced during their manufacture. PLFs possess specific properties that unite them robustly as a group or `category' of flake. The properties that do so, relate most strongly to relative flake thicknesses across their surface area. PLFs also exhibit significantly less variability than the flakes generated during their production. Again, this is most evident in flake thickness variables. A further aim of our study was to assess whether the particular PLF attributes identified during our analyses can be related to current knowledge regarding flake functionality and utility.
Conclusions/Significance: PLFs are standardized in such a manner that they may be considered `predetermined' with regard to a specific set of properties that distinguishes them statistically from a majority of other flakes. Moreover, their attributes can be linked to factors that, based on current knowledge, are desirable features in flake tools (e.g. durability, capacity for retouch, and reduction of torque). As such, our results support the hypothesis that the lengthy, multi-phase, and hierarchically organized process of Levallois reduction was a deliberate, engineered strategy orientated toward specific goals. In turn, our results support suggestions that Levallois knapping relied on a cognitive capacity for long-term working memory. This is consistent with recent evidence suggesting that cognitive distinctions between later Pleistocene hominins such as the Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans were not as sharp as some scholars have previously suggested.},

  abstract = {The Irangi Hills in Kondoa District, central Tanzania, are severely degraded by sheet, rill and gully erosion. Using recently developed optically stimulated luminescence \v{Z}OSL. dating techniques, and a detailed study of the hillslope stratigraphy and soils, we have determined the sequence of events that gave rise to this highly degraded landscape. Two major colluvial deposits have been identified on the slopes. The oldest colluvium gave OSL deposition dates of 14,700 " 1600, 14,200 " 1500 and 11,400 " 1300 years ago. These dates coincide with the climatic change from dry to wet conditions, which took place during the Late Pleistocene. It is possible that the erosion and deposition of the old colluvium occurred as a response to this change. This phase of erosion and deposition was followed by a long phase of stability and pedogenetic alteration of the old colluvium. A phase of accelerated soil erosion began not later than 900 years ago, as indicated by a dated alluvial fan, the presence of which indicates that some deeper gullies already existed on upper pediment slopes at that time. The second, more recent colluvial deposit gave OSL dates of 460 " 40, 590 " 70 and 660 " 50 years. A major period of gully formation and incision, with subsequent fan development, occurred sometime between 600 and 300 years ago. The recent phase of erosion \v{Z}- 1000 years., which is still continuing, is probably a result of the introduction andror intensification of agriculture, livestock husbandry and iron smelting practices in the Irangi Hills. q 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The fossil record provides little support for expectations that the morphological gaps between species or groups of species have increased through time as it might if the gaps were created by extinction of a more homogeneous distribution of morphologies. As the quantitative assessments of morphology have replaced counts of higher taxa as a metric of morphological disparity, numerous studies have demonstrated the rapid construction of morphospace early in evolutionary radiations, and have emphasized the difference between taxonomic measures of morphological diversity and quantitative assessments of disparity. Other studies have evaluated changing patterns of disparity across mass extinctions, ecomorphological patterns and the patterns of convergence within ecological communities, while the development of theoretical morphology has greatly aided efforts to understand why some forms do not occur. A parallel, and until recently, largely separate research effort in evolutionary developmental biology has established that the developmental toolkit underlying the remarkable breadth of metazoan form is largely identical among Bilateria, and many components are shared among all metazoa. Underlying this concern with disparity is a question about temporal variation in the production of morphological innovations, a debate over the relative significance of the generation of new morphologies vs. differential probabilities of their successful introduction, and the relative importance of constraint, convergence and contingency in the evolution of form.},

Despite their tremendous power in comparisons of shape, they do not give information about more general characteristics of shape that may be useful in interpreting function or ecology of an organism. ``Shape descriptors'' are computational representations of shape that can summarise high-level characteristics, such as overall shape or complexity. This paper describes a number of shape descriptors that have been used to capture specific morphological features of mammal teeth. Many of these dental shape descriptors have been valuable as ``ecometrics'', characteristics of organisms that reflect a species' ecology and can be used to reconstruct past environments. Shape descriptors can relate to the gross morphology or to the microwear texture of the tooth surface, as each of these have different characteristics and information regarding function and ecology. While this review concentrates on shape descriptors for teeth, it is hoped that they will give inspiration and stimulation to use and discover additional descriptors for other morphological systems.},

Viewers of these 'creative streams' gather to watch the streamer at work and to interact with the streamer and other audience members. However, little is known about how creative streamers engage with their audience, how their viewership communities form and operate, and how creative streams may support learning. In this study, we used a participant-observer method to study game development streams on the live streaming site Twitch.tv. We found that live streams support the growth of learning-focused communities that mentor both the streamer and each other during and after streams. We show the influence of streamers in creating a space for learning and motivating learners. Finally, we discuss implications for online education and communities of practice.},

Its effectiveness in respect of cognition, however, is occasionally challenged. We briefly review key critiques of its epistemological and methodological limitations and consider alternative options. We suggest a new epistemological position and methodology which can link CO with alternative cognitive models and with the true complexity inherent in the stone tool archaeological record. Perception-action and embodied cognition theory are the proposed foundations of a new epistemology that allows us to reject the concept of thought processes underlying tool-making sequences as static entities selected from memory. Instead, they are described as arising, changing and flowing with and through bodily activity, or as the products of constant interaction between body, mind and environment. They are better understood as ongoing processes of situated task-structuring rather than as objectified concepts or symbols. The new methodology is designed to analyse individual tool-making processes rather than their products. We use a pilot study to explore how it can highlight variations in the gestural processes that structure different technologies and thus indicate potential differences in the associated cognitive strategies of the various tool-makers concerned.},

  abstract = {Background: Early stone tools provide direct evidence of human cognitive and behavioral evolution that is otherwise unavailable. Proper interpretation of these data requires a robust interpretive framework linking archaeological evidence to specific behavioral and cognitive actions.
Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we employ a data glove to record manual joint angles in a modern experimental toolmaker (the 4th author) replicating ancient tool forms in order to characterize and compare the manipulative complexity of two major Lower Paleolithic technologies (Oldowan and Acheulean). To this end we used a principled and general measure of behavioral complexity based on the statistics of joint movements.
Conclusions/Significance: This allowed us to confirm that previously observed differences in brain activation associated with Oldowan versus Acheulean technologies reflect higher-level behavior organization rather than lower-level differences in manipulative complexity. This conclusion is consistent with a scenario in which the earliest stages of human technological evolution depended on novel perceptual-motor capacities (such as the control of joint stiffness) whereas later developments increasingly relied on enhanced mechanisms for cognitive control. This further suggests possible links between toolmaking and language evolution.},

Phylogeographic and paleontological evidence indicates that vegetation changes across Quaternary climate cycles mediated ungulate distributions and dispersals via the opening and closing of biogeographic barriers in equatorial East Africa. Dispersal capabilities would have been enhanced during phases of grassland expansion and diminished during phases of grassland contraction. We propose that the distribution and dispersal of diagnostic technological markers in the archaeological record may be similarly influenced by environmental changes. The Middle Stone Age record from the Lake Victoria region provides intriguing examples of possible environmentally mediated technological dispersals.},

  abstract = {The Protoaurignacian is one of the European techno-complexes that marks the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic. During this time bladelet implements, frequently intended to be hafted in composite tools, become the primary goal of lithic production. The growing number of technological investigations carried out on several assemblages has revealed that, in most cases, bladelets are not the result of the reduction of blade cores. However, the detailed procedures involved in the production of blades and bladelets have rarely been reconstructed. Here we report on diacritic investigations of early stage and exhausted cores from the Protoaurignacian layers of Fumane Cave in northeastern Italy. We show that core reduction is influenced by two distinct operational concepts that relate to the manufacture of different predetermined products. The first is characterized by a linear and consecutive knapping progression that aims to obtain blades and, to a minor extent, bladelets with sub-parallel edges. The second is characterized instead by an alternated knapping progression that is exclusively used to produce slender bladelets with a convergent shape. We also show that carinated cores do not significantly differ, technologically, from semi-circumferential bladelet cores. We conclude by suggesting that there existed strong technological traditions shared between hunter\textendash gatherers across the geographical extent of the Protoaurignacian.},

Once these variables have been represented as scores, an internal model linking the predictors and the response can be developed using standard methods. We call scoring the transformation from a new observation to a score while backscoring is a method to represent a score as an observation in the data space. Both methods are essential for prediction and explanation. We illustrate the methodology for shape data, unregistered curve data and correlation matrices using motion capture data from an experiment to study the motion of children with cleft lip.},

We derive a closed form expression approximating the distribution of forecast errors as a function of time. Based on hind-casting experiments we show that this works well, making it possible to collapse the forecast errors for many different technologies at different time horizons onto the same universal distribution. This is valuable because it allows us to make forecasts for any given technology with a clear understanding of the quality of the forecasts. As a practical demonstration we make distributional forecasts at different time horizons for solar photovoltaic modules, and show how our method can be used to estimate the probability that a given technology will outperform another technology at a given point in the future.},

Taking into account the importance of tool use in human evolution, changes associated with the genus Homo are to be expected in all these three aspects. Haptics is based on both tactile and proprioceptive feedbacks, and it is associated with emotional reactions. Previous analyses have suggested a difference between males and females, and during haptic exploration of different typologies of stone tools. Here, we analyze the correlation between electrodermal reactions during stone tool handling and hand morphology to provide evidence of possible allometric factors shared by males and females. Methods Electrodermal analysis was used to investigate some specific parameters involved in these reactions, such as changes in the level of attention and arousal. We analyzed the responses of 46 right-handed adults to 20 distinct stone tools while blindfolded. Results Females have smaller hands and a wider range of electrodermal reactions. Within males and females, hand diameters and general hand size do not correlate with the degree of electrodermal level and response. Conclusions Sex differences in electrodemal reaction during stone tool handling are apparently not due to the effect of hand size or proportions. Differences between males and females are better interpreted as real sex differences, either due to a biological or cultural influences. Hand size does not influence the degree of arousal or attention during tool exploration, suggesting that other factors trigger individual reactions. These results add to a general cognitive approach on hand-tool evolution and tool sensing.},

This book explores the multiple cultural meanings, historical interpretations, and cosmological values of this extraordinary region by combining archaeological and historical sources with the ethnographic perspectives of four contemporary tribes: Tohono O\~Oodham, Hopi, Zuni, and San Carlos Apache. Previous research in the San Pedro Valley has focused on scientific archaeology and documentary history, with a conspicuous absence of indigenous voices, yet Native Americans maintain oral traditions that provide an anthropological context for interpreting the history and archaeology of the valley. The San Pedro Ethnohistory Project was designed to redress this situation by visiting archaeological sites, studying museum collections, and interviewing tribal members to collect traditional histories. The information it gathered is arrayed in this book along with archaeological and documentary data to interpret the histories of Native American occupation of the San Pedro Valley. This work provides an example of the kind of interdisciplinary and politically conscious work made possible when Native Americans and archaeologists collaborate to study the past. As a methodological case study, it clearly articulates how scholars can work with Native American stakeholders to move beyond confrontations over who \`Oowns\'O the past, yielding a more nuanced, multilayered, and relevant archaeology.},

  abstract = {Innovation is how organizations drive technological change, but the rate of innovation can vary considerably from one technological domain to another. To understand why some domains flourish more rapidly than others, we studied a model of innovation in which products are built out of components. We derived a conservation law for the average size of the product space as more components are acquired and tested our insights using historical data from language, gastronomy, mixed drinks, and technology. We find that the innovation rate is partly influenceable and partly predetermined, similar to how traits are partly set by nurture and partly set by nature. The predetermined aspect is fixed solely by the distribution of the complexity of products in each domain. Different distributions can produce markedly different innovation rates. This helps explain why some domains show faster innovation than others, despite similar efforts to accelerate them. Our insights also give a quantitative perspective on lean methodology, frugal innovation, and mechanisms to encourage tinkering.},

  abstract = {Changing climates, environment, and sea levels during the Middle and Late Pleistocene must have had significant impacts on early modern humans and their behavior. However, many important archaeological sites occur along the current coastline of South Africa where the gradual slope of the offshore Agulhas Bank meant that small changes to sea level height potentially caused significant shifts in coastline position. The geographic context of these currently coastal sites would have been transformed by sea level shifts from coastal to near-coastal to fully terrestrial. To understand human adaptations as reflected in the archaeological deposits of these now-coastal sites we need to accurately model coastline position through time. Here, we introduce a Paleoscape model as a conceptual tool to ground the records for human behavioral evolution within a dynamic model of paleoenvironmental changes. Using integrated bathymetric datasets, GIS, and a relative sea level curve we estimate the position of the coastline at 1.5 ka increments over the last w420,000 years. We compare these model predictions to strontium isotope ratios from speleothems as an independent test and then compare the coastline predictions to evidence for shellfish exploitation through time. Both tests suggest our model is relatively robust. We then widen our paleoscape model to most of the Cape region and compare the predictions of this broadened model to evidence from Blombos cave.},

When the colonists came and from where remains a matter of speculation. This article introduces the Tanginak Spring site, a deeply stratified early Ocean Bay I site on Sitkalidak Island in southeast Kodiak. Lithic raw materials and technologies are examined to evaluate the possibility that this site was first used by early colonists of the archipelago. The evidence suggests a relatively recent migration to Kodiak not much before 7500 cal B.P. (6600 B.P., uncalibrated radiocarbon). Changes in the lithic assemblage over 1,500 years of site use suggest ``regionalization''\textemdash a process of settling in and adapting to local materials and resources. It is always possible to imagine undiscovered sites that will push back human prehistory in a region. Here an attempt is made to direct our attention to positive rather than negative evidence.},

Reconstruction of ancestral demographic history revealed bottlenecks during founder events, likely promoting ecological divergence and genetic drift resulting in a wide range of genome-wide differentiation between pairs of allopatric and sympatric ecotypes. Functional enrichment analyses provided evidence for regional genomic divergence associated with habitat, dietary preferences and post-zygotic reproductive isolation. Our findings are consistent with expansion of small founder groups into novel niches by an initial plastic behavioural response, perpetuated by social learning imposing an altered natural selection regime. The study constitutes an important step towards an understanding of the complex interaction between demographic history, culture, ecological adaptation and evolution at the genomic level.},

Ahead of the construction of the Lesotho Highland Development Authority's (\textsc{LHDA}) new Polihali Dam in Lesotho's Mokhotlong District and following the recommendations of a heritage assessment (\textsc{CES} 2014), a large-scale five-year cultural heritage management program was launched in 2018 that seeks to excavate and mitigate a number of heritage sites.

  abstract = {Strategies employed by Middle Palaeolithic hominins to acquire lithic raw materials often play key roles in assessing their movements through the landscape, relationships with neighboring groups, and cognitive abilities. It has been argued that a dependence on local resources is a widespread characteristic of the Middle Palaeolithic, but how such behaviors were manifested on the landscape remains unclear. Does an abundance of local toolstone reflect frequent encounters with different outcrops while foraging, or was a particular outcrop favored and preferentially quarried? This study examines such behaviors at a finer geospatial scale than is usually possible, allowing us to investigate hominin movements through the landscape surrounding Lusakert Cave 1 in Armenia. Using our newly developed approach to obsidian magnetic characterization, we test a series of hypotheses regarding the locations where hominins procured toolstone from a volcanic complex adjacent to the site. Our goal is to establish whether the cave's occupants procured local obsidian from preferred outcrops or quarries, secondary deposits of obsidian nodules along a river, or a variety of exposures as encountered while moving through the river valley or across the wider volcanic landscape during the course of foraging activities. As we demonstrate here, it is not the case that one particular outcrop or deposit attracted the cave occupants during the studied time intervals. Nor did they acquire obsidian at random across the landscape. Instead, our analyses support the hypothesis that these hominins collected obsidian from outcrops and exposures throughout the adjacent river valley, reflecting the spatial scale of their day-to-day foraging activities. The coincidence of such behaviors within the resource-rich river valley suggests efficient exploitation of a diverse biome during a time interval immediately preceding the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic ``transition,'' the nature and timing of which has yet to be determined for the region.},

Given the outstanding preservation of art and architecture at Dura, it is not surprising that four obsidian artifacts have escaped attention, despite evidence that stone tools \textendash{} including obsidian ones \textendash{} continued to be used into and after the Iron Age in the Eastern Mediterranean. After more than eight decades, the character of Dura's connections to the Classical world remains a matter of debate. Pottery includes not only local ceramic wares but also North African and Aegean ones. Our nondestructive pXRF testing establish that the Dura artifacts match the three most widely used Eastern Anatolian obsidian sources: Nemrut Da\u{g} volcano as well as the Bing\"ol A and B sources. If indeed obsidian arrived at Dura via long-standing mechanisms of Mesopotamian exchange, these Eastern Anatolian obsidians would be expected. Unfortunately, the artifacts' precise locations at Dura are unclear, the excavations lacked stratigraphic constraints, and Near Eastern obsidian distribution patterns have been rarely studied beyond the Early Bronze Age. Keeping in mind these limitations, our findings are most consistent with past suggestions regarding the importance of local Mesopotamian influences and resources at the site.},

The results showed a serious problem: all three criteria exhibit a systematic bias toward selecting unnecessarily complex models containing spurious random variables and erroneously suggest a high level of support for the incorrectly ranked best model. These problems effectively increased with increasing sample size. The failure of AIC, AICc, and BIC was likely driven by the inflated sample size and different sum-of-squares partitioned by MRM, and the resulting effect on delta values. Based on these findings, we strongly discourage the continued application of AIC, AICc, and BIC for model selection with MRM.},

  abstract = {This thesis considers the association between western Melanesian ethnographic
economic specialisation and prehistoric systems of production and distribution.
Contrasting theories for the development of historical specialisation are reviewed and
the criticism made that these are chronologically limited to the late Holocene. The
statement is made that to fully appreciate temporal change we must expand our view
to encompass the preceramic period.
Obsidian is one of the few archaeologically visible materials which was distributed in
both preceramic and ceramic times. This material is chosen as a ``measuring device''
to map variation in production and distribution patterns in the Admiralty Islands,
Papua New Guinea. A review of ethnographic and anthropological literature revealed
that the Admiralty Islands were characterised by a high level of village or lineagebased economic specialisation. Obsidian was one of the materials produced and
distributed within this system.
A study was carried out on obsidian use at Pamwak Rocksheiter on Manus Island,
and at a number of mid to late Holocene localities on Manus and Mouk.
Characterisation analysis revealed that offshore obsidian, probably from the Pam
Islands, began to be utilised in the terminal Pleistocene. Trends of increasing
accessibility through time and a move to incorporate increasing quantities of Lou
obsidian were revealed. A significant discovery is the possibility of a major increase in
the use of Lou obsidian coincident with the appearance of Lapita.
Retouched obsidian blades and microblades were found to be present in only postLapita contexts. Chronological change in blade production strategies was revealed on
Lou. This involved the development of highly standardised triangular forms by
approximately 1600-1300 BP, followed by a simplification of technology as reflected
in the appearance of minimally modified tanged forms. This occurred within the last
1000 years and is interpreted as showing increased demand for weapon points. This
demonstrates a move toward the form of spearpoint production recorded by
nineteenth century ethnographers.
The conclusion drawn is that none of the models yet advanced for the devlopment of
economic specialisation in Melanesia is adequate for interpreting change in production
and distribution in the Admiralty Islands. The roots of economic specialisation may
lie further back in time than catered for by existing models.},

A critical insight derived from the model is that the very success of an adaptation at the level of an individual forager group can create system-level vulnerabilities that subsequently feed back to cause emergent social change. The model illustrates how the intensification of harvest time by individuals within a habitat creates a forager-resource system that becomes vulnerable to perturbations. When the system is vulnerable, it is characterized by two resource harvest equilibria: a sustainable, low-effort equilibrium and a degraded, high-effort equilibrium. In this situation, the forager-resource system can be shocked back and forth between these different equilibria by perturbations, generating considerable risk for foragers. We use the model to isolate the ecological conditions under which the instability of the system generates the risk that foragers will experience a shortfall of resources, and we suggest a mechanism that might lead foragers to adopt social institutions that regulate who can access a habitat as an adaptive response. As an illustration of the potential utility of the insights drawn from the model, comparisons are made with a substantial ethnographic data set.},

  abstract = {The present-day research on lithic analysis provides very different approaches how stone artifacts can be recorded, analyzed, and interpreted. Most scholars agree today that a purely typological view should be avoided. The last three decades provided a technological approach to lithic research. Likewise, there are also very different approaches how lithic assemblages should be classified. Beside the Bordes-Binford debate if assemblages can be seen as made by distinct groups or if they are functional units, many other hypotheses have been formulated (like environmental, transformative or recycling approaches, production analysis, core classification criteria, as well as functional analysis within use-wear or hafting studies). In the context of lithic analysis, Eric Bo\"eda's research is of outstanding interest, because he formulated many technological approaches that are very often used, and in some research traditions they are nearly standard. This paper uses his newly published work (Bo\"eda 2013) as an opportunity to resume his litho-technological approaches, but also to discuss Bo\"eda's approaches and try to integrate these into the context of lithic analysis.},

  abstract = {The Neolithic transition from hunting and gathering to farming and cattle breeding marks one of the most drastic cultural changes in European prehistory. Short stretches of ancient mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from skeletons of pre-Neolithic hunter-gatherers as well as early Neolithic farmers support the demic diffusion model where a migration of early farmers from the Near East and a replacement of pre-Neolithic hunter-gatherers are largely responsible for cultural innovation and changes in subsistence strategies during the Neolithic revolution in Europe. In order to test if a signal of population expansion is still present in modern European mitochondrial DNA, we analyzed a comprehensive dataset of 1,151 complete mtDNAs from present-day Europeans. Relying upon ancient DNA data from previous investigations, we identified mtDNA haplogroups that are typical for early farmers and hunter-gatherers, namely H and U respectively. Bayesian skyline coalescence estimates were then used on subsets of complete mtDNAs from modern populations to look for signals of past population expansions. Our analyses revealed a population expansion between 15,000 and 10,000 years before present (YBP) in mtDNAs typical for hunters and gatherers, with a decline between 10,000 and 5,000 YBP. These corresponded to an analogous population increase approximately 9,000 YBP for mtDNAs typical of early farmers. The observed changes over time suggest that the spread of agriculture in Europe involved the expansion of farming populations into Europe followed by the eventual assimilation of resident hunter-gatherers. Our data show that contemporary mtDNA datasets can be used to study ancient population history if only limited ancient genetic data is available.},

Only six artefacts had retouch. Specific activities identified includethe processing of plant (wood,starchy, resinousand siliceousmaterials) and animal tissue (flesh, skin and bone). Discrete activity areas were not identified. However, the minimal evidence for stone working and the small number of identified tasks indicated by the usewear and residue analysis suggest an expedient use of the small shelter for domestic tasks, including plant food processing. The study demonstrates that an integrated approach, which examines both residues and usewear, has very high potential for determining the functions of not only fine-grained stones, like chert, but also quartz and the coarsegrained quartzites and silcretes, commonly found in many Australian archaeological sites.},

The data are evaluated using current stratigraphic and biostratigraphic frameworks together with geochronology to provide a much reduced list of sites which can be attributed with greater confidence to MIS 5e and a further list of sites that can be reasonably assigned to MIS 7. A comparison of these enables an assessment of whether biases in the nature of the sites, type of investigations, collection history or other factors are responsible for the discovery of archaeological evidence from these sites. This review of the data supports the interpretation that humans were absent from Britain or that there was only a very sparse presence during MIS 5e. This model, however, should be subjected to further systematic testing as sites become available. Finally, ideas are discussed as to why humans should have been absent or scarce in Britain at this time, concluding that the island status of Britain and the low population of Neanderthals in northwest Europe are contributory factors.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates how coastal mobility and a community's place within regional trade networks intersect with technological organisation. To do this, we identified different types of lithic production and exchange during the late pre-colonial period at three coastal sites around Madang in northeast New Guinea. The study is the first major technological and sourcing study in this area. Consistent with terrestrial models, lithic technological analysis crucially shows that groups with higher levels of coastal mobility (1) were reducing a wider range of lithic materials and (2) reduced material less intensively than groups with indirect access. Conversely, groups with lower coastal mobility levels (1) were flaking a restricted range of lithic materials and (2) reduced material more intensively. Geochemical analysis, using X-ray fluorescence, shows that at all three sites obsidian artefacts exclusively derived from Kutau/Bao (Talasea) in West New Britain. This indicates that, by about 600 years ago through to the late nineteenth century, the Kutau/Bao source had become a specialised export product, being fed into major distribution conduits operational along the northeast coast. Importantly, there is no evidence for exchange with other sources such as Admiralties or Fergusson Island obsidian. This is contrastive to the Sepik coast, where obsidian from the Admiralties Islands featured prominently alongside West New Britain obsidian, and suggests the emergence of different coastal supply lines feeding the northeast Madang coast and the north Sepik coast.},

An analysis of the Kiowa lithic assemblage was used to examine the interplay between tool technology, mobility levels, and subsistence strategies by investigating changes in the procurement, manufacture, and use of different raw stone materials in an overall lithic technology. Throughout Kiowa's occupation local stone was used extensively, and over time people increased their knowledge of the local lithic landscape, using more diverse local raw materials. Since the terminal Pleistocene, people carried reliable polished axes for a variety of activities and made expedient use of locally abundant river pebbles, while smaller nodules were located and carried as mobile toolkits to facilitate longer distance hunting and collecting excursions. In the mid Holocene exotic raw materials were also traded from more distant zones. The abandonment of Kiowa in the late Holocene shows that hunting became less economically important as cultivation developed in the area. Technological changes, in combination with changes in faunal remains are suggestive of increasing activity at Kiowa through the Holocene as the site became specialised for bat hunting, perhaps driven by restricted land use and reduced mobility, reciprocally affected by increasing populations and the intensification of plant food production in the Highlands generally. Despite this, evidence for changes to horticulture around Kiowa itself, in the Chimbu area, is limited to the mid-late Holocene, indicating that the early development of agriculture in the Wahgi may have been relatively localised, and did not necessarily displace existing subsistence strategies elsewhere in the Highlands.},

Neanderthals have been studied in various disciplines, giving rise to a range of opinions about them. This article raises the question in a theological perspective, asking what a Thomist should make of the status of Neanderthals, whether they were created in the image of God and Christ died for their sins. Having examined what light might be thrown on their status by that of angels and aliens, it is asked whether Neanderthals are part of the same human family as sapiens. Genetics has shown that sapiens and Neanderthals had offspring, leaving Eurasian sapiens with about two per cent Neanderthal DNA, including our Lady, and implying that, when the Word became flesh, the Word became partly Neanderthal. Since reconciling Catholic teaching on Monogenism with the results of population genetics implies interbreeding between humans properly defined by a subsistent immaterial soul and a wider population, there is reason to ask whether the meeting of Neanderthals and sapiens may also have been an example of interbreeding. Possible evidence for Neanderthals possessing a subsistent immaterial soul, and so being part of the same human family as sapiens, is assessed.},

The most comprehensive sequences are found in East Africa, where, in largescale syntheses, the Lower Pleistocene Acheulean (LPA) has often been considered a uniform cultural entity. Furthermore, the emergence and development of Acheulean technology are seen as linked to the emergence and evolution of Homo ergaster/erectus. The criterion for grouping together different lithic assemblages scattered over space and time is the presence of large cutting tools (LCTs), more than of any other component. Their degree of refinement has been used, in turn, as a parameter for evaluating Acheulean development and variability. But was the East African LPA really uniform as regards all components involved in lithic productions? The aim of this paper is to evaluate the techno-economic similarities and differences among LPA productions in a specific micro-regional and environmental context, i.e. at Melka Kunture, in the Ethiopian highlands, and in a specific period of time: between \textasciitilde 1.5 Ma, when some of the earliest Acheulean complexes appeared, and 1.0-0.85 Ma, when LCTs productions became intensive and widespread. Our detailed comparative analyses investigate all aspects and phases of the cha\^ines op\'eratoires. Since hominin fossil remains were discovered at some of the analyzed sites, we also discuss differences among lithic productions in relation to the changing paleoanthropological record. Our studies show that at Melka Kunture the LPA techno-complexes cannot be grouped into a single uniform entity. The assembled evidence points instead to ``two Acheuleans'' well-defined by a strong discontinuity in various aspects of techno-economic behaviors. This discontinuity is related to a major step in human evolution: the transition from Homo ergaster/ erectus to Homo heidelbergensis.},

  abstract = {The need for structures capable of accommodating complex evolutionary signals such as those found in, for example, wheat has fueled research into phylogenetic networks. Such structures generalize the standard model of a phylogenetic tree by also allowing for cycles and have been introduced in rooted and unrooted form. In contrast to phylogenetic trees or their unrooted versions, rooted phylogenetic networks are notoriously difficult to understand. To help alleviate this, recent work on them has also centered on their ``uprooted'' versions. By focusing on such graphs and the combinatorial concept of a split system which underpins an unrooted phylogenetic network, we show that not only can a so-called (uprooted) 1-nested network N be obtained from the Buneman graph (sometimes also called a median network) associated with the split system \textbackslash documentclass[12pt]\{minimal\}

Our aim is to present a population history of this sub-continental region by providing a chronologically-secure framework for the interpretation of data from genetics and archaeology. In particular, we define five population events in this period, using dates-as-data, and examine the implications for the archaeology of Late Glacial colonization. We contrast this detailed regional approach to the larger project which we call the cognitive origins synthesis that includes historical linguistics in the reconstruction of population history. We conclude that only archaeology can currently provide the framework for population history and the evaluation of genetic data. Finally, if progress is to be made in the new interdisciplinary field of population history then both disciplines need to refrain from inappropriate agricultural thinking that fosters distorting models of European prehistory, and they should also pay less, if any, attention to historical linguistics.

Results show that the variability generated while copying depends on both the difficulty of the task and the cultural learning niches of the potters.

Direct dating of the lower hominid-bearing level was carried out on volcanic glass and minerals using the 40Ar/39Ar method. The concordant results from two different sampled locations allow the determination of the age of the earliest human presence in Eurasia.

In this study we report on the cross-cultural occurrence of various modes and processes of social learning in distinct cultural domains from the ethnographic record. To our knowledge this is the first systematic, cross-cultural study of hunter-gatherer social learning. We rely on the sample of hunter-gatherers in the electronic Human Relations Area Files (eHRAF) to generate our source of ethnographic texts. We have coded and analyzed 982 ethnographic texts from 23 diverse societies. Oblique and vertical transmission appear at similar rates. Various forms of teaching are the most common processes of social learning and account for more than half of all coded texts. Vertical and oblique social learning are predominantly characterized by teaching, whereas horizontal social learning is primarily through collaborative learning. Approximations of age reveal a general developmental pattern in which social learning of miscellaneous skills characterizes infancy, subsistence skills dominate early and middle childhood, and the social learning of religious beliefs are most frequent during adolescence. Across development we identify a reduction in the importance of vertical transmission in favor of oblique transmission, for subsistence skills in particular. These results highlight the importance of teaching in the ethnographic record of hunter-gatherer social learning and provide a systematic, cross-cultural, framework for theoretical models to rely on.},

  abstract = {Microevolutionary patterns in populations of introduced rodent species have often been the focus of analytic studies for their potential relevance to understanding vertebrate evolution. The Polynesian rat (Rattus exulans) is an excellent proxy species because of its wide geographic and temporal distribution: its native and introduced combined range spans half the globe and it has been living for at least seven centuries wherever it was introduced. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of long-term isolation (insularity; up to 4,000 years) and geographic variables on skull shape variation using geometric morphometrics. A sample of 513 specimens from 103 islands and four mainland areas was analysed. This study, to my knowledge the first to extensively sample introduced rats, analysed 59 two-dimensional landmarks on the skull. Landmarks were obtained in three separate aspects (dorsal, lateral, ventral skull view). The coordinate data were then subjected to a multivariate ordination analysis (principal components analysis, or PCA), multivariate regressions, and a canonical variates analysis (CVA). Three measures of disparity were evaluated for each view. The results show that introduced Polynesian rats evolve skull shapes that conform to the general mammalian interspecific pattern of cranial evolutionary allometry (CREA), with proportionally longer snouts in larger specimens. In addition, larger skulls are more tubular in shape than the smaller skulls, which are more balloon-shaped with a rounder and wider braincase relative to those of large skulls. This difference is also observed between the sexes (sexual dimorphism), due to the slightly larger average male size. Large, tubular skulls with long snouts are typical for Polynesia and Remote Oceania, where no native mammals occur. The greater disparity of Polynesian rats on mammal species-poor islands ('exulans-only' region) provides further insight into how diversity may affect diversification through ecological release from predators and competitors.},

Based on distributional data, oxidation experiments, and geologic sourcing of both clays and volcanic ash, a production zone for the ash-tempered white ware is isolated. The occurrence of this pottery on Kayenta sites outside of the production zone is interpreted as resulting from intraregional exchange that started during Pueblo II. By middle Pueblo III production and exchange of the ash-tempered white ware intensified, so that by late Pueblo III this pottery constituted a majority of the white ware at many Kayenta sites. Based on our research findings, we suggest avenues for future investigation of intraregional Kayenta ceramic exchange.},

Most researchers interpret the record as reflecting the existence of two developmentally related cultural groups, the Baradostian of the early UP and the Zarzian of the late UP or Epipalaeolithic. In this paper we analyse techno-typological characteristics of early UP assemblages from the Zagros to assess the degree of variability. We use here new chronometric and typo-technological data from the early UP assemblages of the cave site Gha\textasciimacron{} r-e Boof in the north western Fars province of Iran and compare these data with key sites of the Zagros UP, including Shanidar, Warwasi and Yafteh. Our study reveals important technological differences between assemblages from these sites, which led us to argue that the UP record of the Zagros Mountain range reflects multiple technological traditions instead of a single one. We further argue that a model reflecting a mosaic pattern for the evolution of the early UP in the Zagros Mountains fits better with the increasing evidence for a chronologically deep and spatially complex process of the spread of modern human populations over Southwest Asia.},

  abstract = {This paper aims to understand the cultural diversity among the first modern human populations in the Iranian Zagros and the implications of this diversity for evolutionary and ecological models of human dispersal through Eurasia. We use quantitative data and technotypological attributes combined with physiogeographic information to assess if the Zagros Upper Paleolithic (UP) developed locally from the Middle Paleolithic (MP), as well as to contextualize the variation in lithics from four UP sites of Warwasi, Yafteh, Pasangar, and Gha r-e Boof. Our results demonstrate (1) that the Zagros UP industries are intrusive to the region, and (2) that there is significant cultural diversity in the early UP across different Zagros habitat areas, and that this diversity clusters in at least three groups. We interpret this variation as parallel developments after the initial occupation of the region shaped by the relative geotopographical isolation of different areas of the Zagros, which would have favored different ecological adaptations. The greater similarity of lithic traditions and modes of production observed in the later phases of the UP across all sites indicates a marked increase in inter-group contact throughout the West-Central Zagros mountain chain. Based on the chronological and geographical patterns of Zagros UP variability, we propose a model of an initial colonization phase leading to the emergence of distinct local traditions, followed by a long phase of limited contact among these first UP groups. This has important implications for the origins of biological and cultural diversity in the early phases of modern human colonization of Eurasia. We suggest that the mountainous arc that extends from Anatolia to the Southern Zagros preserves the archaeological record of different population trajectories. Among them, by 40 ka, some would have been transient, whereas others would have left no living descendants. However, some would have led to longer term local traditions, including groups who share ancestry with modern Europeans and modern East/Southeast Asians.},

In this paper we present the initial report of a new well-dated Late Acheulean assemblage from the Hugub open-air locality (Ethiopia). The Hugub Bed, an excavated 10\textendash 20cm archaeological unit, is rich with in situ artifacts and paleoenvironmental data. In this vast exposed area, the fauna and depositional context suggest a seasonally inhabited lakeshore environment adjacent to xeric grasslands. The studied lithic assemblage yields numerous, often diminutive broad-tipped ovate and pointed bifaces made on large flakes. These show the earliest evidence of intensive on-site resharpening as well as the earliest use of the plano-convex method. This emergent pattern of tool production, maintenance, and discard is typical for the post-Acheulean industries and has no analogs among earlier Acheulean-making populations of Homo erectus. Single crystal 40Ar/39Ar dates on tuffs bracket the Hugub Bed between 600 and 500 thousand years ago, making this locality the earliest securely dated Late Acheulean archaeology in Africa.},

The Upper Palaeolithic assemblages from Gebel Maghara (northern Sinai) are analysed here since they include assemblages which are dominated by El-Wad points and assemblages which are dominated by retouched bladelets. Since all the assemblages are broadly contemporaneous, it is argued that this dichotomy is due to functional variability. It is demonstrated that in certain cases retouched bladelets were produced as early as 30,000 B.C.

Here, we describe a comprehensive set of analyses that identified 126 high-frequency archaic haplotypes as putative targets of adaptive introgression in geographically diverse populations. These loci~are enriched for immune-related genes (such as~OAS1/2/3, TLR1/6/10, and TNFAIP3) and also encompass genes (including OCA2 and BNC2) that influence skin pigmentation phenotypes. Furthermore, we leveraged existing and novel large-scale gene expression datasets to show many positively selected archaic haplotypes act as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), suggesting that modulation of transcript abundance was a common mechanism~facilitating adaptive introgression. Our results demonstrate that hybridization between modern and archaic hominins provided an important reservoir of advantageous alleles that enabled adaptation to out-of-Africa environments.},

Perhaps most impressive is the diversity of our technologies, broadly defined as all the physical objects we produce and the skills we use to produce them. Despite considerable focus on the evolution of technology by social scientists and philosophers, there have been few attempts to systematically quantify technological diversity, and therefore the dynamics of technological change remain poorly understood. Here we show a novel Bayesian model for examining technological diversification adopted from palaeontological analysis of occurrence data. We use this framework to estimate the tempo of diversification in American car and truck models produced between 1896 and 2014, and to test the relative importance of competition and extrinsic factors in shaping changes in macro-evolutionary rates. Our results identify a four-fold decrease in the origination and extinction rates of car models, and a negative net diversification rate over the last 30 years. We also demonstrate that competition played a more significant role in car model diversification than either changes in oil prices or gross domestic product. Together our analyses provide a set of tools that can enhance current research on technological and cultural evolution by providing a flexible and quantitative framework for exploring the dynamics of diversification.},

  abstract = {Network analysis using hunter-gatherer archaeological data presents a number of unique challenges. At the forefront of these challenges are issues associated with the aggregation and fragmentation of archaeological data that influence the size, density, and confidence in network models. These methodological challenges are unfortunate, as the diverse roles of social networks among hunter-gatherers have long been recognized within anthropological research. In order to enhance the research potential of networks constructed from hunter-gatherer archaeological data, this research highlights two data evaluation methods established in social science research to assess the stability of network structure. More specifically, this research constructs network models from the compositional analysis of ceramic artifacts recovered in the Kuril Islands of northeast Asia and evaluates network centrality measures using bootstrap simulation and sensitivity analysis. Results of this research suggest that while archaeologists may never fully identify the ``true'' network of past relationships, network models that approximate ``true'' network structure can provide useful metrics in exploring the behavior of past hunter-gatherer populations. Overall, given the challenges associated with hunter-gatherer archaeological data, it is argued here that critically evaluating the structure and stability of network models is an essential first step in developing an archaeological network analysis that is relevant and informative to research on past small-scale societies.},

Also discussed are problems of chronology and periodization of the Mongolian Upper Paleolithic based on radiocarbon dating, including new determinations available for the Tolbor-4 and 15 sites, along with associated archaeological materials. The early stage of the Early Upper Paleolithic (EUP) in Mongolia persisted for a relatively long period and can be divided into two sub-chrons, the earliest ranging from 40 to 35,000 BP. The later stage of the Mongolian EUP, falling between 33 and 26,000 BP, is represented by assemblages from the Khangai Mountains (e.g., Tolbor-4 and 15, Orkhon-7) and the Gobi Altai district (e.g., Tsagaan Agui Cave, Chikhen Agui Rockshelter, Chikhen-2). The middle Upper Paleolithic in Mongolia has been identified only on the basis of sites in the Orkhon River valley, all of which post-date ca. 25,000 BP. The material culture of this long period is characterized by the complete replacement of blade industries by flake industries, along with the parallel development of the pressure-flaked microblade technique. The later phase of the Mongolian Upper Paleolithic is well-dated down to the end of the Pleistocene. Typical industries include those excavated at Tolbor-15, which are characterized by the predominance of microcores reduced by both pressure and percussion, the appearance of retouched points on flakes, and an increase in the number of microblades as a fraction of overall blade blanks.},

  abstract = {The Channel Islands Barbed point type occurs on the three larger northern Channel Islands off the coast of southern California. The points are small, unusually thin, and carefully knapped, and occur in archaeological assemblages dating between 12,100 and 7,800 cal B.P. Based on points of this type in museum collections compiled during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century and a lesser number from recent investigations, we present a typology of Channel Islands Barbed points consisting of seven subtypes, with the objective of facilitating investigation into their spatiotemporal patterning. The delicate character of the points implies that the spears or darts on which they were hafted were used to acquire fauna in aquatic environments or were thrust rather than thrown, given that they would be highly vulnerable to breakage if thrown on land. Although having a very limited geographic distribution, the Channel Islands Barbed point type is comparable in quality of knapping to other Paleoindian and early Archaic types found elsewhere in North America.},

  abstract = {The archaeological deposits at Mumba rockshelter, northern Tanzania, have been excavated for more than 70 years, starting with Margit and Ludwig K\"ohl-Larsen in the 1930s. The assemblages of Middle Stone Age (MSA) and Later Stone Age (LSA) artefacts collected from this site constitute the type sequences for these cultural phases in East Africa. Despite its archaeological importance, however, the chronology of the site is poorly constrained, despite the application since the 1980s of several dating methods (radiocarbon, uranium-series and amino acid racemisation) to a variety of materials recovered from the deposits. Here, we review these previous chronologies for Mumba and report new ages obtained from optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) measurements on single grains of quartz and multi-grain aliquots of potassium (K) feldspar from the MSA and LSA deposits. Measurements of single grains of quartz allowed the rejection of unrepresentative grains and the application of appropriate statistical models to obtain the most reliable age estimates, while measurements of K-feldspars allowed the chronology to be extended to older deposits. The seven quartz ages and four K-feldspar ages provide improved temporal constraints on the archaeological sequence at Mumba. The deposits associated with the latest Kisele Industry (Bed VI-A) and the earliest Mumba Industry (Bed V) are dated to 63.4 {$\pm$} 5.7 and 56.9 {$\pm$} 4.8 ka (thousands of years ago), respectively, thus constraining the time of transition between these two archaeological phases to \textasciitilde 60 ka. An age of 49.1 {$\pm$} 4.3 ka has been obtained for the latest deposits associated with the Mumba Industry, which show no evidence for post-depositional mixing and contain ostrich eggshell (OES) beads and abundant microlithics. The Nasera Industry deposits (Bed III) contain large quantities of OES beads and date to 36.8 {$\pm$} 3.4 ka. We compare the luminescence ages with the previous chronologies for Mumba, and briefly discuss how the revised chronology fits in the context of existing archaeological records and palaeoclimatic reconstructions for East Africa.},

  abstract = {Far'ah II is an open-air site in the north western Negev desert (Israel). Previous excavations in the 1970's revealed a rich, in situ Middle Paleolithic (MP) assemblage composed of flint and limestone artifacts, animal bones and charcoal. Renewed excavation at the site were undertaken in 2017, to re-date it and provide a more accurate constrain to the sites' age, as well as collect samples for paleoclimatic proxies. Our new Optically Stimulated Luminescence and 14C ages together with the stable oxygen isotope signature of the loess sediments, constrain the age of the upper archaeological horizon to {$<$}49 ka. This age agrees with the younger limit of 60\textendash 50 ka, obtained by Electron Spin Resonance ages, measured in the 1990's. The heavy {$\delta$}18O values in carbonates point to cooler climatic conditions than those that prevailed during the preceding short, warm episode between 58 and 49 ka. The fauna, pollen and charcoal collected during the excavation portray a savanna-like environment with a mix of Irano-Turanian and Saharo-Arabian elements and a minor Mediterranean component. The lithic assemblage exhibits large technological variability typical of the Late MP (LMP), amongst which are technological traits that are clearly present in the Initial Upper Paleolithic (IUP) assemblages at the nearby, and roughly contemporaneous, site of Boker Tachtit. If population replacement was the trigger to the MP-UP transition, we would have expected to see a clear break in the cultural material at the onset of the Upper Paleolithic. The semi-arid north western Negev, as an interim region between the Mediterranean and Saharo-Arabian ecozones could have facilitated interaction between populations moving north or south due to fluctuating climatic conditions and changes in population pressures, possibly leading to the emergence of new technological traditions that are observed in the later UP.},

  abstract = {Fundamental disagreements remain regarding the relative importance of climate change and human activities as triggers for Madagascar's Holocene megafaunal extinction. We use stable isotope data from stalagmites from northwest Madagascar coupled with radiocarbon and butchery records from subfossil bones across the island to investigate relationships between megafaunal decline, climate change, and habitat modification. Archaeological and genetic evidence support human presence by 2000 years Before Common Era (BCE). Megafaunal decline was at first slow; it hastened at \textasciitilde 700 Common Era (CE) and peaked between 750 and 850 CE, just before a dramatic vegetation transformation in the northwest that resulted in the replacement of C3 woodland habitat with C4 grasslands, during a period of heightened monsoonal activity. Cut and chop marks on subfossil lemur bones reveal a shift in primary hunting targets from larger, now-extinct species prior to \textasciitilde 900 CE, to smaller, still-extant species afterwards. By 1050 CE, megafaunal populations had essentially collapsed. Neither the rapid megafaunal decline beginning \textasciitilde 700 CE, nor the dramatic vegetation transformation in the northwest beginning \textasciitilde 890 CE, was influenced by aridification. However, both roughly coincide with a major transition in human subsistence on the island from hunting/foraging to herding/farming.},

In Mesoamerica, recent research has cast doubt on these views, with the recognition of early market place exchange, production by households for exchange, and the wideranging integration of communities into regional trade networks. Here, we expand on an earlier network analysis of obsidian assemblages from the Maya region during the Classic and Postclassic periods to incorporate data for all of Mesoamerica between 900 BC and AD 1520. Using both visual graphical representations and formal network metrics, we find that the Mesoamerican economy was dynamic and generally not highly centralized over time. The topology of this interactive network underwent significant changes over time. In particular, trends towards decreasing network hierarchy and size culminated in the highly commercialized ``international'' economy of Late Postclassic period as noted in previous studies. Based on this analysis, we make the case that the ancient Mesoamerican economy was neither predominantly top-down nor static, and so does not conform with oft-held presumptions regarding preindustrial economies.},

DNA analyses have generally indicated that both lineages diverged during the middle period of the Middle Pleistocene, an inferred time that has strongly influenced interpretations of the hominin fossil record. This divergence time, however, is not compatible with the anatomical and genetic Neanderthal affinities observed in Middle Pleistocene hominins from Sima de los Huesos (Spain), which are dated to 430 thousand years (ka) ago. Drawing on quantitative analyses of dental evolutionary rates and Bayesian analyses of hominin phylogenetic relationships, I show that any divergence time between Neanderthals and modern humans younger than 800 ka ago would have entailed unexpectedly rapid dental evolution in early Neanderthals from Sima de los Huesos. These results support a pre\textendash 800 ka last common ancestor for Neanderthals and modern humans unless hitherto unexplained mechanisms sped up dental evolution in early Neanderthals.},

The issue concerning the geographical and chronological origin of microblade technology in Northeast Asia remains a widely debated concern, not only as new data emerge, but also due to researchers having different definitions of the term ``microblade'' and ``microblade core''. In this case, by microblade technology, I refer to the systematic production of microblades using the pressure knapping technique. I therefore review the data in light of this defining feature and conclude that, based on the present state of research, pressure knapping microblade technology probably emerged in the Far East (China, Korea, or Japan) around 30,000\textendash 25,000 cal BP, in spite of most authors considering that microblade technology emerged in southern Siberia 40,000\textendash 35,000 years ago.

This component consists of a microblade and burin industry with clear technological ties to the Siberian Upper Paleolithic Diuktai Culture. Through the systematic use of the Yubetsu method for the production of microblades, Swan Point is technologically more similar to Siberian microblade sites than to later-age (Denali complex) microblade sites in Alaska. The Yubetsu method is the hallmark of the Diuktai Culture, and in Alaska, Swan Point CZ4b is the only component with systematic production of microblades using the Yubetsu method. Other late Pleistocene and Holocene microblade sites in Alaska have an industry based on Campus-style, conical, or tabular microblade cores. Analysis of the collection furthers our understanding of how CZ4b relates to previous Siberian Diuktai-related assemblages and to later Alaskan Denali-related sites. We interpret the CZ4b component as representing a brief single event that has major cultural and technological implications for the early colonization process of North America.

  abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the chipped stone assemblage recovered in the six week 2001 field season at the PPNA settlement of Dhra' located in south Jordan. The Dhra' site excavations produced a lithic assemblage that in numbers is comparable, or even surpasses, that of Netiv Hagdud. Lithic analysis is ongoing, and this paper represents a detailed preliminary discussion of the technology, typology, and distributional patterns yielded by the Dhra' lithic assemblage. Some initial comparisons are made between these results and other PPNA lithic assemblages recovered in the southern Levant. Pr\'esentation de l'industrie lithique recueillie en 2001 lors d'une campagne de fouilles de six semaines sur le site PPNA de Dhra' au sud de la Jordanie. Les fouilles sur ce site ont produit un assemblage lithique qui est comparable ou m\^eme surpasse par sa qualit\'e celui de Netiv Hagdud. L'analyse \'etant en cours nous pr\'esentons ici une discussion d\'etaill\'ee de la technologie, de la typologie et de la r\'epartition dans le site de l'assemblage lithique. Quelques premi\`eres comparaisons peuvent \^etre faites entre nos r\'esultats et ceux obtenus sur d'autres sites PPNA du Sud-Levant.},

The upper flow is dated (40 Ar/39 Ar) to 233,000 {$\pm$} 3,000, and the lower one to ca. 800,000 years ago. The lithic assemblage is comprized of varied tool types: bifaces, scrapers, notches, denticulates as well as end scrapers and burins in relatively high frequencies. Technologically the assemblage is typified by the discoidal and the Levallois techniques. The geological history of the site is highly complex, and proves that the site was formed before the creation of the Berekhat Ram crater lake. The chrono-stratigraphical data combined with the results obtained through the lithic analyses contribute further information towards a better understanding of Pleistocene cultural deposits in the Levant.

In this paper, we define and describe this Acheulean tool type and discuss its size, morphology, and technology. We demonstrate that at GBY these tools were shaped on flakes that were side-products of the reduction sequence to produce bifaces (handaxes and cleavers). We hypothesize that these blanks were rejected as potential bifaces during the knapping sequence but considered suitable for the retouching of massive scrapers, and were set aside for future work. We support our view with data from archaeological finds younger than those of GBY, as well as with evidence from controlled experimental knapping and ethnoarchaeological observations.

A dissimilaritybased framework incorporating space explicitly is an extremely flexible tool for answering these questions. The R package ecodist brings together methods for working with dissimilarities, including some not available in other R packages. We present some of the features of ecodist, particularly simple and partial Mantel tests, and make recommendations for their effective use. Although the partial Mantel test is often used to account for the effects of space, the assumption of linearity greatly reduces its effectiveness for complex spatial patterns. We introduce a modification of the Mantel correlogram designed to overcome this restriction and allow consideration of complex nonlinear structures. This extension of the method allows the use of partial multivariate correlograms and tests of relationship between variables at different spatial scales. Some of the possibilities are demonstrated using both artificial data and data from an ongoing study of plant community composition in grazinglands of the northeastern United States.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE. The Distance Vision Scale (DVS) is a self-assessment of visual acuity (VA). Like VA testing in which letter reading becomes progressively difficult through the test, DVS questions have a hierarchy of difficulty (Guttman scale). The aims were to determine whether the DVS fulfills Guttman scaling criteria and to test the relationship between DVS score and VA in a cataract population.
METHODS. Responses of 113 participants to the DVS were subjected to Guttman analysis. Standard criteria of scalability were evaluated that included the coefficient of reproducibility (CR), minimal marginal reproducibility (MMR), and coefficient of scalability (CS). The relationship between total item score and binocular visual acuity was determined.
RESULTS. Five participants were excluded because of missing data. Regularity in the banding pattern of the scalogram of the 108 participants was suggestive of a deterministic Guttman scale. Analyses showed that DVS satisfies the criteria for classification as a valid unidimensional and cumulative scale, as CS (0.93), CR (0.99), and MMR (0.85) values fall within the desired range. The statistically significant correlation between the total item score and binocular VA was 0.24.
CONCLUSIONS. The DVS fits the Guttman scale, supporting the deterministic model underlying the scale. It correlates poorly with VA, suggesting it taps aspects of visual performance and other issues beyond high-contrast VA. The DVS could be used as an outcome measure to evaluate change over time and could be used to set achievable treatment objectives because of its hierarchical properties.

Such variation has functional and possibly stylistic implications. The paper gives a review of the archae ology of Kariandusi, and then investigates the question of size and shape variation in bifaces. The Upper Sites at Kariandusi, first investigated by L. S. B. Leakey, have yielded many obsidian bifaces which can be dated to approximately 0.7-1.0 myr ago. Material from the Lower Site, including many lava bifaces, is judged to be stratigraphically younger but probably in the same time range. We show by making comparisons with the neigh bouring Acheulean sites of Kilombe and the Kapthurin Formation that allometry is pre sent in biface assemblages at least 0.5 myr different in date; that similar principles of allometry operate in all the assemblages; and that where there are differences of allometric pattern, within-site variation is sometimes greater than variation between distant sites. We conclude that the size of a biface at least partly determines the shape in which it was made, and that sites in the time range of Homo erectas and early Homo sapiens show surpris ingly similar allometric patterns.},

  abstract = {Percussion makes a vital link between the activities of early human ancestors and other animals in tool-use and tool-making. Far more of the early human actions are preserved as archaeology, since the percussion was largely used for making hard tools of stone, rather than for direct access to food. Both primate tools and early hominin tools, however, offer a means to exploring variability in material culture, a strong focus of interest in recent primate studies. This paper charts such variability in the Acheulean, the longest-lasting tool tradition, extant form about 1.7 to about 0.1 Ma, and well known for its characteristic handaxes. The paper concentrates on the African record, although the Acheulean was also known in Europe and Asia. It uses principal components and discriminant analysis to examine the measurements from 66 assemblages (whole toolkits), and from 18 sets of handaxes. Its review of evidence confirms that there is deep-seated pattern in the variation, with variability within a site complex often matching or exceeding that between sites far distant in space and time. Current techniques of study allow comparisons of handaxes far more easily than for other components, stressing a need to develop common practice in measurement and analysis. The data suggest, however, that a higher proportion of traits recurs widely in Acheulean toolkits than in the chimpanzee record.},

Given a set of circumstances or processes, what other possible network shapes could have emerged? This is the problem of equifinality, where many different means could potentially arrive at the same end result: the networks that we observe. This paper outlines how agent-based modelling can be used as a laboratory for exploring different processes of archaeological network formation. We begin by describing our best guess about how the (ancient) world worked, given our target materials (here, the networks of production and patronage surrounding the Roman brick industry in the hinterland of Rome). We then develop an agent-based model of the Roman extractive economy which generates different kinds of networks under various assumptions about how that economy works. The rules of the simulation are built upon the work of Bang (2006; 2008) who describes a model of the Roman economy which he calls the `imperial Bazaar'. The agents are allowed to interact, and the investigators compare the kinds of networks this description generates over an entire landscape of economic possibilities. By rigorously exploring this landscape, and comparing the resultant networks with those observed in the archaeological materials, the investigators will be able to employ the principle of equifinality to work out the representativeness of the archaeological network and thus the underlying processes.},

It focuses on the social networks created during the Lower Magdalenian of the Cantabrian region (Spain), and visible through similarities of portable art representations. It uses Species Distribution Modeling and Maximum Classification Likelihood on faunal presence data to reconstruct prehistoric biomes, and contextualize the networks reconstructed through the art analysis. It demonstrates the potential of mapping the recreated networks onto the reconstructed biomes and of identifying the linked sites' foraging and minimal band territories to distinguish between local mobility movement and inter-group social alliances. The results show that, during the Lower Magdalenian, the majority of movements seen through artistic similarities probably represent the seasonal mobility of one or two hunter-gatherer groups, and that only a few intersite links represent social networks used to exchange mates and gather information.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary thinking can be applied to both cultural microevolution and macroevolution. However, much of the current literature focuses on cultural microevolution. In this article, we argue that the growing availability of large cross-cultural datasets facilitates the use of computational methods derived from evolutionary biology to answer broad-scale questions about the major transitions in human social organization. Biological methods can be extended to human cultural evolution. We illustrate this argument with examples drawn from our recent work on the roles of Big Gods and ritual human sacrifice in the evolution of large, stratified societies. These analyses show that, although the presence of Big Gods is correlated with the evolution of political complexity, in Austronesian cultures at least, they do not play a causal role in ratcheting up political complexity. In contrast, ritual human sacrifice does play a causal role in promoting and sustaining the evolution of stratified societies by maintaining and legitimizing the power of elites. We briefly discuss some common objections to the application of phylogenetic modeling to cultural evolution and argue that the use of these methods does not require a commitment to either gene-like cultural inheritance or to the view that cultures are like vertebrate species. We conclude that the careful application of these methods can substantially enhance the prospects of an evolutionary science of human history.},

  abstract = {The set of papers in this volume on various aspects of the Reber-Ralcival Lapila site offers an opportunity for some additional commentary, although each paper provides its own conclusions. Three themes are explored. The fust evaluates Meyer's original observations in the light of what bas been learned from the more recent investigations. The outcome is quite favourable to Meyer. The second draws the more recent investigations together to answer the question: in what sense is Reber-Rakival to be seen as a chronologically very late example of a Lapila site, typical of those usually assigned to the cultural complex, but one which also covers the transition to something else in the fust few centuries AD? The answer, as might be expected, varies according to the temporal, ceramic, non-ceramic artefact, economic, settlement, and biological evidence under consideration. In general, however, the conclusion that it began as a Lapila site appears soundly based. Finally, some of the unresolved issues about the site are highlighted and suggestions made about bow some of them might be tackled through future research.},

  abstract = {The transition from the Middle Paleolithic (MP) to the Upper Paleolithic (UP), circa 40kya, is viewed as a major turning point in human evolution, in terms of the material culture, demography, and geographical expansion of modern humans. However, attempts to identify an origin of this so-called `revolution' in the form of a particular stone-tool techno-complex, representing cultural modernity, which spread across the human range, have failed. Instead, the archaeological record of this period comprises multiple `transitional techno-complexes', some associated with modern humans and others with Neanderthals. The cultures that these techno-complexes represent are characterized by precursors of the material cultures of the UP, often alongside features that suggest local cultural continuity. The broadly simultaneous appearance of these transitional cultures, despite a lack of a clear common origin, is puzzling. We suggest that these local `revolutions' had a common underlying driver, which explains the simultaneous appearance of transitional techno-complexes, but that this driver did not determine the particular form of each local revolution. We propose that the driver of the transition to the UP was an increase in interpopulation connectivity, both within- and between-species, which allowed local cultures to rapidly evolve and to attain greater complexity than ever before. We suggest that this change was driven by the interaction between modern humans and Neanderthals. In this article we outline processes that are likely to have influenced inter-population connectivity, bringing together evolutionary and ecological perspectives alongside insights from the field of cultural evolution.},

We show that Neandertals shared more genetic variants with present-day humans in Eurasia than with present-day humans in sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting that gene flow from Neandertals into the ancestors of non-Africans occurred before the divergence of Eurasian groups from each other.},

  author = {Green, R.C},
  abstract = {Among portable artifacts the adze has most often been favoured by
students of Polynesia in reconstructing the cul ture history of the area and
the origins of its peoples. Of the possibilities previously considered for
origin of the Polynesian adze kit, however, an immediate origin in Eastern
Melanesia is one most uniformly rejected. This paper explores that
possibility by means of early dated assemblages of adzes from Fiji, Tonga,
Samoa, the Society Islands, Marquesas and Wairau Bar. It maintains that with
only a few quite probable innovations the East Polynesian adze kit can be
derived from an ancestral one found in West Polynesia, and this in turn can be
derived from an even earlier adze kit present in the Lapita cultural complex
widespread in Eastern Melanesia. While such a hypothesis is likely to prove
controversial and will be unacceptable to some because it stands in sharp
contrast to the results of previous studies based on the distributions of
adzes from surface collections, the excavation evidence requires that the
hypothesis be examined more closely and given more c onsideration than it has
in current literature now appearing on the subject.},

The goal of this study is to test several predictions regarding cervical morphology and intervertebral ranges of motion. Materials and Methods Intervertebral ranges of motion for 12 primate species were collected via radiographs or taken from the literature. Morphometric data describing functionally relevant aspects of cervical vertebral morphology were obtained from museum specimens representing these species. We tested for correlations between intervertebral movement and vertebral form using phylogenetic generalized least-squares regression. Results Results demonstrate limited support for the hypothesis that range of motion (ROM) is influenced by cervical vertebral morphology. Few morphological variables correlate with ROM and no relationship is consistently significant across cervical joints. Discussion These results indicate that the relationship between vertebral morphology and joint ranges of motion is, at most, weak, providing little support the use of bony morphology to reconstruct axial mobility in fossil specimens. Future work should investigate the role of soft tissues in vertebral joint stability.},

Given its chronological position at the threshold of the Neolithic (ca. 12,000 years ago) and its geographic setting in the productive Jordan Valley, the site of Nahal Ein Gev II (NEG II) reveals aspects of the Late Natufian adaptations and its implications for the transition to agriculture. The size of the site, the thick archaeological deposits, invested architecture and multiple occupation sub-phases reveal a large, sedentary community at least on par with Early Natufian camps in the Mediterranean zone. Although the NEG II lithic tool kit completely lacks attributes typical of succeeding Pre Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) assemblages, the artistic style is more closely related to the early PPNA world, despite clear roots in Early Natufian tradition. The site does not conform to current perceptions of the Late Natufians as a largely mobile population coping with reduced resource productivity caused by the Younger Dryas. Instead, the faunal and architectural data suggest that the sedentary populations of the Early Natufian did not revert back to a nomadic way of life in the Late Natufian in the Jordan Valley. NEG II encapsulates cultural characteristics typical of both Natufian and PPNA traditions and thus bridges the crossroads between Late Paleolithic foragers and Neolithic farmers.},

  abstract = {Several hundred Middle Palaeolithic (MP) archaeological sites have now been identified in the Arabian Peninsula. However, the study of lithic raw material properties and related procurement behaviours is still in its infancy. Here we describe raw material procurement and early stage lithic reduction at MP sites in the Jubbah palaeolake basin, in the Nefud Desert, northern Saudi Arabia. We describe the sites identified during our surveys, and we use petrographic studies to demonstrate that MP assemblages were mostly produced from differing forms of ferruginous quartzite. These raw materials do not substantially vary in composition, although they are not identical in terms of factors such as grain size and the proportion of iron oxide. We then describe the lithic technology at these sites, with a particular focus on the largest assemblage identified, Jebel Katefeh-12 (JKF-12), which provides detailed information on lithic reduction at a quartzite source. Analyses from this site are then considered together with data from other MP sites in the Jubbah basin, where similar raw material was used. The results indicate that factors such as initial clast size/shape and reduction intensity play important roles in influencing aspects of morphological and technological variability. Our results suggest that incursions of MP populations into northern Arabia were probably temporally limited, as might be expected in a marginal and generally arid region. MP raw material procurement sites provide a highly visible signal of these ephemeral incursions, providing information on the ways that human populations adapted to the challenging conditions of the Saharo-Arabian arid belt.},

  abstract = {The Levantine sites of Skhul and Qafzeh have been interpreted as indicating an early, short and unsuccessful expansion of Homo sapiens out of Africa. Chronometric age estimates, however, indicate a history of prolonged occupation, and suggest that Skhul (\textasciitilde 130e100 thousand years ago [ka]) may have been occupied earlier than Qafzeh (beginning \textasciitilde 110e90 ka). Morphologically, the Skhul individuals can be described as somewhat more primitive in comparison to the Qafzeh fossils. Though the lithic assemblages of sites such as Skhul and Qafzeh are often described as being technologically similar, as part of the `Tabun C' phase/industry, limited detailed information on the Skhul lithic assemblage has been published, and little comparative work has been conducted. Here, we present an analysis of the Skhul stone tool assemblage to describe its characteristics, to evaluate the lithic results against the fossil and chronological data, and for inter-site regional comparison. Our findings indicate that the Skhul lithic assemblage differs from other Levantine Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5 sites, such as Qafzeh. For example, there was more of an emphasis on diverse methods of point production at Skhul, and the available samples indicate a greater emphasis on preferential rather than recurrent Levallois reduction at Skhul. The current findings suggest that neither the Levantine Middle Palaeolithic in general, nor MIS 5 assemblages in particular, were technologically homogeneous. These data are consistent with either a long occupation of the Levant by Homo sapiens in MIS 5, or at least two phases of occupation (early MIS 5 and mid to late MIS). Whatever the fate of the Skhul and Qafzeh population(s), their occupation of the Levant was neither short nor culturally uniform. Our findings add to the growing pool of evidence that the dispersal of our species `Out of Africa' was more complex than hitherto thought. Further work on MIS 5e contexts in the Levant and elsewhere in Southwest Asia should be a research priority.},

  abstract = {The Cenozoic harrats (lavafields) of western Arabia constitute one of the major volcanic areas of the world. Recent precise chronometric dating of volcanic rocks in Harrat Rahat makes it possible to outline a detailed chronology of volcanic activity. Likewise, recent advances in archaeology have demonstrated that early humans repeatedly occupied the Arabian Peninsula in the Pleistocene. Most archaeological sites in Arabia correlate with phases of increased rainfall, such as interglacials. However, we should be cautious about reducing the prehistory of Arabia to simply the story of rainfall fluctuation. This paper explores the impacts of volcanism on human populations in Arabia, as a case study of causality and scale in human-environment interactions. Periodic environmental `windows of opportunity' allowed early human groups to expand into western Arabia. However, the western highlands are also home to volcanically active areas that saw repeated eruptions. In the Holocene a major eruption occurred in western Arabia around every 300 years, and the emerging evidence for Pleistocene volcanism demonstrates repeated major eruptions at the same times as early humans were occupying the area. As well as offering a review of human-volcanism interactions in Arabian prehistory, a model is proposed in which volcanic activity in western Arabia may have facilitated further population dispersal. As well as negative health impacts as a `push factor', a balanced perspective on the impacts of volcanism, and associated phenomena such as earthquakes, emphasises possibly positive impacts in terms of factors such as water availability and the formation of fertile volcanic soils. These positive impacts may have offered `pull factors', and facilitated regional occupation longer than would be predicted based on climatic variables alone. This framework offers not only an explanation for some of the characteristics of the Arabian archaeological record, but potentially offers part of the explanation for how early human populations were able to pass through the Saharo-Arabian arid belt from our African birthplace to populate the rest of the world.},

  abstract = {The influence of ecology on the development of behavioral traditions in animals is controversial, particularly for chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), for which it is difficult to rule out environmental influences as a cause of widely observed community-specific behavioral differences. Here, we investigated 3 potential scenarios that could explain the natural variation in a key extractive tool behavior, ``fluid-dip,'' among several communities of chimpanzees of the Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii subspecies in Uganda. We compared data from previous behavioral ecological studies, field experiments, and long-term records of chimpanzee tool-using behavior. We focused on the quality of the available food, dietary preferences, and tool sets of 5 different communities, and carried out a standardized field experiment to test systematically for the presence of fluid-dip in 4 of these communities. Our results revealed major differences in habitat, available diet, and tool use behavior between geographically close communities. However, these differences in ecology and feeding behavior failed to explain the differences in tool use across communities. We conclude that ecological variables may lead both to innovation and loss of behavioral traditions, while contributing little to their transmission within the community. Instead, as soon as a behavioral tradition is established, sociocognitive factors likely play a key maintenance role as long as the ecological conditions do not change sufficiently for the tradition to be abandoned.},

          In recent years, fairly far-reaching claims have been repeatedly made about how niche construction, the modification by organisms of their environment, and that of other organisms, represents a vastly neglected phenomenon in ecological and evolutionary thought. The proponents of this view claim that the niche construction perspective greatly expands the scope of standard evolutionary theory and that niche construction deserves to be treated as a significant evolutionary process in its own right, almost at par with natural selection. Claims have also been advanced about how niche construction theory represents a substantial extension to, and re-orientation of, standard evolutionary theory, which is criticized as being narrowly gene-centric and ignoring the rich complexity and reciprocity of organism-environment interactions. We examine these claims in some detail and show that they do not stand up to scrutiny. We suggest that the manner in which niche construction theory is sought to be pushed in the literature is better viewed as an exercise in academic niche construction whereby, through incessant repetition of largely untenable claims, and the deployment of rhetorically appealing but logically dubious analogies, a receptive climate for a certain sub-discipline is sought to be manufactured within the scientific community. We see this as an unfortunate, but perhaps inevitable, nascent post-truth tendency within science.},

  abstract = {There is a ``package'' of cultural innovations that are claimed to reflect modern human behaviour. The introduction of the ``package'' has been associated with the Middle-to-Upper Palaeolithic transition and the appearance in Europe of modern humans. It has been proposed that modern humans spread from Africa with the ``package'' and colonised not only Europe but also southern Asia and Australia (McBrearty and Brooks, 2000; Mellars, 2006a). In order to evaluate this proposal, we explore the late Pleistocene archaeological record of Sahul, the combined landmass of Australia and Papua New Guinea, for indications of these cultural innovations at the earliest sites. It was found that following initial occupation of the continent by anatomically and behaviourally modern humans, the components were gradually assembled over a 30,000-year period. We discount the idea that the ``package'' was lost en route to Sahul and assess the possibility that the ``package'' was not integrated within the material culture of the initial colonising groups because they may not have been part of a rapid colonisation process from Africa. As the cultural innovations appear at different times and locations within Sahul, the proposed ``package'' of archaeologically visible traits cannot be used to establish modern human behaviour. Whilst the potential causal role of increasing population densities/pressure in the appearance of the ``package'' of modern human behaviour in the archaeological record is acknowledged, it is not seen as the sole explanation because the individual components of the ``package'' appear at sites that are widely separated in space and time.},

K7 is situated on the Har Harif plateau in the central Negev highlands. The lithic assemblage from our excavation at the site shows all stages of production except for the raw material procurement, which was conducted outside of the Har Harif environment. Based on the lithic industry, K7 is attributed to the Late Ramonian (ca. 14,000 BP) cultural phase. The site is one of the largest Ramonian sites excavated in the Negev highlands. Its extent indicates multiple returns of hunters and gatherers to the area of the Har Harif summit and plateau during a period of climatic amelioration.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we described the daily activities of Pygmy hunter-gatherer children living in a foraging forest camp. Our two aims were (1) to clarify their time use and participation in food procurement activities and (2) to evaluate their contribution to food acquisition. The authors accompanied the children on an 8-day hunt and conducted direct observations on six children, focusing on one of them each day (12 h; 06:00\textendash 18:00). All foods brought back to the camp were identified and weighed, and their energy and protein values were calculated. Children were considered to be generally physically active, and they participated in food procurement activities about 3 h in a day, which was nearly the same amount of time as the Baka adults spent on those activities. Boys mainly spent their time rat hunting (101.7 min), while girls spent more time bail fishing (120.3 min) than rat hunting (60.0 min). Although the children spent more time foraging and had a greater number of participants engaged in it, the total amount of game that adults obtained was much greater (2787 g obtained by children and 12,273 g by adults). Each game brought back by adults (e.g., tortoises or vipers) was also generally heavier than that of children (e.g., rats or galago). Children often move in groups of four to eight people and perform most food acquisition activities with at least three to four people. Regarding the transition of their activity patterns as they got older, we hypothesized that boys tend to act alone or in smaller units, whereas girls continue to act in groups that contain people of various ages.},

Excavations were conducted by McMaster in the late 1960s, and by the University of Toronto, Mississauga since 2000. These excavations demonstrate that Princess Point was used by native peoples from Early Archaic times (8000\textendash 6000 B.C.) through to the end of the Woodland period at A.D. 1650. The most intense occupation occurred during the Early Late Woodland period (A.D. 500\textendash 1000) by people of the Princess Point Complex. Euro-Canadians began using Princess Point during the late eighteenth century. In the twentieth century, the promontory was incorporated into the Royal Botanical Gardens.},

Using analytical arguments, we find that the accumulated copying error model predicts negative drift in quantitative data due to the proportional nature of compounded copying errors (i.e., neutral mutations), and the multiplicative process of cultural transmission. Further, we find that the theoretically predicted rate of drift in long-lived technologies is remarkably close to the observed reduction of Clovis projectile point size through time and space across North America.},

Journal of Anthropology archaeology 24, 316\textendash 334.] provides a rich, quantitative framework with which to model the cultural transmission of quantitative data. Using analytical arguments, we find that the accumulated copying error model predicts negative drift in quantitative data due to the proportional nature of compounded copying errors (i.e., neutral mutations), and the multiplicative process of cultural transmission. Further, we find that the theoretically predicted rate of drift in long-lived technologies is remarkably close to the observed reduction of Clovis projectile point size through time and space across North America.},

  abstract = {A key feature of the distribution of life on Earth is the positive correlation between environmental productivity and biodiversity. This correlation also characterizes the distribution of human cultural diversity, which is highest near the equator and decreases exponentially toward the poles. Moreover, it is now understood that the tropics house more biodiversity than would be expected from energy availability alone suggesting ``diversity begets diversity''. Here we show the same is also true for human cultural diversity. This convergence is particularly striking because while the dynamics of biological and cultural evolution may be similar in principle the mechanisms and time scales involved are very different. However, a common currency underlying all forms of diversity is ecological kinetics; the temperature-dependent fluxes of energy and biotic interactions that sustain life at all levels of biological and social organization. Using macroecological theory and the analysis of global databases we show both mammal diversity and cultural diversity scale superlinearly with environmental productivity at rates predicted by the ecological kinetics of environmental productivity. Diversity begets diversity in human cultures and mammal species because the kinetics of energy availability and biotic interactions result in superlinear scaling with environmental productivity.},

  abstract = {The expansion of the human species out of Africa in the Pleistocene, and the subsequent development of agriculture in the Holocene resulted in waves of linguistic diversification and replacement across the planet. Analogous to the growth of populations or the speciation of biological organisms, languages diversify over time to form phylogenies of language families. However, the dynamics of this diversification process are unclear. Bayesian methods applied to lexical and phonetic data have created dated linguistic phylogenies for 18 language families encompassing \textasciitilde 3,000 of the world's \textasciitilde 7,000 extant languages. In this paper we use these phylogenies to quantify how fast languages expand and diversify through time both within and across language families. The overall diversification rate of languages in our sample is \textasciitilde 0.001 yr-1 (or a doubling time of \textasciitilde 700 yr) over the last 6,000 years with evidence for nonlinear dynamics in language diversification rates over time, where both within and across language families, diversity initially increases rapidly and then slows. The large-scale replacement of the world's hunter-gatherer languages by agricultural languages over the Holocene was a non-constant process.},

Here, the current evidence for plants is summarised, and the way this can be used to enrich perceptions of the Lower and Middle Palaeolithic are explored. The evidence for plant food fits well with basic nutritional requirements while the presence of medicinal plants correlates with plant-based selfmedication by animals. Many plant-based technologies are likely to have developed early in the Palaeolithic. Though investigating this is challenging due to a lack of evidence, the extensive evidence for use of plant materials as tools by chimpanzees provides a broad backdrop. The ecological knowledge carried by all hominins would have provided a safety net when moving into new regions, while varying levels of neophobia would have enabled adaptation to new environments as hominin populations moved and climates changed. Recent plant use among traditional societies in high latitudes shows that even in locations with reduced biodiversity, plant resources can fulfil essential dietary requirements.},

DNA sequences of the mitochondrial control region were obtained from 34 of the 40 described species (including subspecies: 56 taxa). As the study was based mainly on museum material, several specimens did not yield the full length marker sequence. In these cases, only a short section of the control region could be analysed. Nevertheless, even these individuals could be assigned tentatively to clades established on the full length marker sequence. Inclusion of sequences of other corvid genera as available in GenBank clearly confirmed the monophyly of the genus Corvus. Within the Corvus clade several distinct subclades can be distinguished. Some represent lineages of single species or species pairs while other clades are composed of many species. In general, the composition of the clades reflects geographical contiguousness and confirms earlier assumptions of a Palearctic origin of the genus Corvus with several independent colonizations of the Nearctic and the Aethiopis. The Australasian radiation seems to be derived from a single lineage. The distribution of plumage colour in the phylogenetic tree indicates that the pale markings evolved several times independently. The white {$\fracslash$} grey plumage colour pattern \textendash{} which is found also in other genera of the family Corvidae, for example, in Pica \textendash{} occurs already in the species pair representing the first split within the genus Corvus (Corvus monedula, Corvus dauuricus). Thus, reversal to full black colour seems to have occurred as well. The use of colour traits as a phylogenetic marker within Corvus should be considered with severe caution.},

The use of flotation for macrobotanical remains beginning in the 1960s and 1970s coupled with the application of accelerator mass spectrometry dating beginning in the 1980s has led to substantial revisions of knowledge about the history of these crops in the region. A complementary source of evidence for the crops' histories in the eastern North America comes from opal phytoliths. Analysis of phytolith assemblages recovered from charred food residues has shown that maize and squash were being used in central New York well before the macrobotanical record indicates. In combination with previously analyzed samples, 16 additional residue assemblages help to clarify the history of maize and squash in central New York.

            R\'esum\'e
            El fechamiento de las adopciones del ma\'iz y la calabaza a trav\'es del este de Norte America ha sido un t\'opico de inter\'es por mucho tiempo para arque\'ologosy paleobot\'anicos. La utilizaci\'on del m\'etodo de flotaci\'on para restos macrobotd\'aicos comenz\'o en los 1960s y 1970s, emparej\'o con la aplicaci\'on del fechamiento por Acelerador de Espectr\'ometro de Masa, el cual comenz\'o en los 1980s, esto ha llevado a revisiones substanciales en el conocimiento acerca de la historia de estos cultivos en la regi\'on. Una fuente complementaria de evidencia para las historias de los cultivos en el este de Norteam\'erica proviene de fitolitos de \'opalo. An\'alisis de colecciones de fitolitos en residuos de alimentos han demostrado que el ma\'iz y la calabaza fueron utilizados en el centro de Nueva York mucho antes de lo que el record macrobot\'anico indica. En combinaci\'on con muestras previamente analizadas, 16 colecciones de residuos adicionales ayudan a clarificar la historia del ma\'iz y la calabaza en el centro de Nueva York. Los resultados indican que el ma\'iz y la calabaza fueron utilizados en Nueva York en 2270 B.P. y 2945 B.P., respectivamente.},

  abstract = {Through detailed analysis of artifactual and architectural materials, several researchers, notably Woodson (1999), have inferred that certain late pueblo ruins in southeast Arizona were built by immigrants from northern Arizona. It has gone nearly unnoticed that this conclusion is specifically verified by testimony ofmembers ofthe Coronado Expedition, who passed through the region in 1540. The most detailed account-apparently based on information from native informants-states that what the Spaniards called a "fortress"-like pueblo ruin in southeast Arizona had been occupied by "foreigners" who came from the region ofCibola. We introduce new evidence that Coronado's party may have been aware of other pueblo ruins in southeast Arizona. Records from the Coronado entrada have been underused in interpreting life in the late stages of Southwest prehistory, partly because the Coronado route is poorly known in many areas. With recent discoveries, however, we are entering a new period in which the Coronado eyewitness testimony can be understood well enough to be used to complement archaeological data on late Southwestern prehistory.},

Non-human species feature rarely, appearing in the detritus if they were eaten, as domestic animals or for early archaeology, as dating evidence. This week's Review article summarizes the known overlaps between primatology and archaeology and goes on to make the case for a new field, primate archaeology. By examining the past and present material record of primates a number of important questions can be tackled from a new perspective. Primates use tools, create living sites and construct social groups. All these activities leave their mark in the archaeological record, and with it the evidence that puts the evolution of cognition and tool use in humans into context.},

Rituals probably helped hold alliances together. These conclusions indicate that there were language or dialect groups that were probably ethnically self-conscious. Some of the postulated band ranges and population densities in the literature appear unrealistic. Sexual division of labour was probably pronounced and Neandertals appear to have used rudimentary status markers, including predator pelts, bird wings or claws, colorants, and a range of speciality items.},

(1983) as an example of such confusion. In reality no confusion is implied in the statement. Instead, Moholy-Nagy's criticism and the manner in which she defines her basic units reflect an overly narrow and simplistic conception of workshop and workshop dump.

  abstract = {Field schools are essential for undergraduate students pursuing careers in archaeology, but they are expensive and, consequently, inaccessible to many. Although there have been efforts to rectify this through the creation of scholarships, there have been no systematic studies of the full cost of archaeological field schools. Here, we present a study of 208 field schools from 2019, including their tuition, room and board, and airfare, as well as the wages that students may lose by participating in them rather than working. We also explore how archaeologists interviewed for Heath-Stout's dissertation study of diversity issues in the discipline have navigated finding field experiences. We argue that scholarships are an ineffective and insufficient means of promoting equity and accessibility in the field because the root of the problem lies in institutionalized inequality and exclusivity. We provide strategies that students and faculty can use to address these problems on both individual and systemic levels. By making field schools affordable and accessible to a more diverse set of undergraduate students, we can create a more just and inclusive discipline., Las escuelas de campo son esenciales para los estudiantes universitarios en arqueolog\'ia, pero son muy caras y por tanto inaccesibles para muchos de ellos. Aunque hay iniciativas para solucionar este problema mediante la creaci\'on de becas, no se ha realizado ning\'un estudio sistem\'atico sobre los costos completos de estas escuelas de campo.

  abstract = {Archaeologists have traditionally collected artifacts during survey in order to analyze them in a laboratory setting and curate the artifacts and associated documentation for future analysis, interpretation, and preservation. In recent decades, however, there has been a trend in the western United States to avoid collection during survey and to relegate most artifact analysis to the field, typically conducted by field crew. Despite heavy reliance on in-field analysis to characterize sites during survey, very little is known about how accurate and adequate in-field analysis is for site interpretation and management. This article presents the findings of a pilot experiment that tested in-field analysis and digital photograph analysis at two sites in the western United States using multiple quantitative measures and qualitative assessments. The results of the analysis show that in-field analysis has a strong potential to yield inaccurate and highly variable results that can lead to the misidentification and misinterpretation of important site components. We recommend that sample collections be made during survey, where possible, and properly curated. For projects in which in-field analysis is used, we recommend that in-field analysis be tested using similar methods to determine whether it can meet an acceptable standard.},

Furthermore, larger-brained species reach their adult skill levels later than smaller-brained ones, largely because they start later with the simplest techniques. These findings demonstrate that these motor behaviors are not modular and that their slow development may constrain their evolution. Complex foraging techniques therefore critically require a slow life history with low mortality, which explains the limited taxonomic distribution of flexible tool use and the unique elaboration of human technology.},

The numerical tests show the capability of the presented method to detect abrupt change time-instants in model time series generated by Logistic map. Moving DFA (MDFA) and approximate entropy (ApEn) can provide some information such as a single time-instant of abrupt dynamic change, but both of them cannot exactly detect all of the abrupt change regions. Some traditional methods, such as moving t-test, Cramer method, Mann\textendash Kendall test and Yamamoto method, even cannot provide any information of abrupt dynamic change in these model time series. Meanwhile, results showed that windows sizes and strong noise have some less effect on the MC-DFA results. In summary, MC-DFA provides a reliable measure to detect the abrupt dynamic change in correlated time series, and perfectively make up the deficiencies of MDFA and ApEn. The applications in daily surface air pressure records further verify the validity of the present method. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2011 Royal Meteorological Society},

  abstract = {A combination of archeological and ethnohistorical evidence indicates that, over an approximately 8,000-year period, from the beginning of the Holocene until European explorers began arriving in the eighteenth century, the societies of Tasmania lost a series of valuable skills and technologies. These likely included bone tools, cold-weather clothing, hafted tools, nets, fishing spears, barbed spears, spear-throwers, and boomerangs. To address this puzzle, and the more general question of how human cognition and social interaction can generate both adaptive cultural evolution and maladaptive losses of culturally acquired skills, this paper constructs a formal model of cultural evolution rooted in the cognitive details of human social learning and inference. The analytical results specify the conditions for differing rates of adaptive cultural evolution, and reveal regimes that will produce maladaptive losses of particular kinds of skills and related technologies. More specifically, the results suggest that the relatively sudden reduction in the effective population size (the size of the interacting pool of social learners) that occurred with the rising ocean levels at the end of the last glacial epoch, which cut Tasmania off from the rest of Australia for the ensuing ten millennia, could have initiated a cultural evolutionary process that (1) kept stable or even improved relatively simple technological skills, and (2) produced an increasing deterioration of more complex skills leading to the complete disappearance of some technologies and practices. This pattern is consistent with the empirical record in Tasmania. Beyond this case, I speculate on the applicability of the model to understanding the variability in rates of adaptive cultural evolution.

            Resumen
            La evidencia arqueol\'ogica y etnohist\'orica indica que, a lo largo de aproximadamente 8,000 a\~nos, desde el principio del Holoceno hasta la llegada de exploradores europeos en el sigh XVIII, las sociedades de Tasmania perdieron gran parte de su cultura tecnol\'ogica. Las herramientas que desaparecieron probablemente incluyen el hueso, ropa resistente al fr\'io, los instrumentos enmangados, arpones, lanzas de p\'uas, los lanza-lanzadores y los bumerangs. \textquestiondown C\'omo es posible que se perdiera todo esto? Para resolver este misterio, y tambi\'en esclarecer deforma m\'as general c\'omo el conocimiento humano y la interacci\'on social pueden generar adaptaciones y tambi\'en la p\'erdida de las mismas, e inclusive malas adaptaciones, en este art\'iculo se construye un modelo formal de la evoluci\'on cultural que se basa en detalles cognoscitivos del aprendizaje y la inferencia humanos en el \'ambito social. Los resultados anal\'iticos especifican los reg\'imenes de condiciones bajo los cuales la evoluci\'on cultural genera adaptaciones, y tambi\'en los reg\'imenes contrastantes bajo los cuales seproducen p\'erdidas que representan malas adaptaciones tanto de habilidades como de las tecnolog\'ias vinculadas con ellas. M\'as espec\'ificamente, los resultados sugieren que la reducci\'on relativamente repentina en el tama\~no eficaz de la poblaci\'on (el tama\~no del grupo de aprendices sociales), es la causa m\'as importante de estas p\'erdidas culturales. El motor ecol\'ogico de esta reducci\'on fue el alza del nivel del mar en la \'epoca final de la glaciaci\'on pasada, que tuvo como efecto separar a Tasmania del resto de Australia durante los \'ultimos diez milenios. La consecuencia fue un deterioro de las habilidades m\'as complejas con las cuales contaba esta poblaci\'on. El expediente empir\'ico de la arqueolog\'ia en Tasmania confirma este patr\'on. M\'as all\'a de este caso particular, se presentan especulaciones acerca de la aplicabilidad de este modelo para entender la variabilidad en los \'indices de la evoluci\'on cultural adaptativa en el marco tecnol\'ogico.},

Drawing from these debates, this paper disputes five common claims: (1) mental representations are rarely discrete, and therefore models that assume discrete, gene-like particles (i.e., replicators) are useless; (2) replicators are necessary for cumulative, adaptive evolution; (3) content-dependent psychological biases are the only important processes that affect the spread of cultural representations; (4) the ``cultural fitness'' of a mental representation can be inferred from its successful transmission; and (5) selective forces only matter if the sources of variation are random. We close by sketching the outlines of a unified evolutionary science of culture.},

With the Natufian we see a transition from a foraging strategy based upon high residential mobility and movement to resources (i.e., simple foraging) to one of reduced mobility where intensification and the logistical acquisition of resources (i.e., complex foraging) were common (Henry 1989a; Tchernov 1991). This transition appears to have been triggered by the intensive exploitation of plant foods, especially cereals, nuts, and legumes. The demographic and social consequences of the economic change were striking. Population growth at regional and community levels appears to have been associated with increased social complexity as indicated by social ranking along with enhanced artistic and ceremonial activities (Henry 1989a, 1991; BelferCohen 1991; Noy 1991).},

The focus of the book is on understanding the degree to which the behavioral organization of Archaic groups differed from Moderns. To this end, a case study is presented for a 44-70,000 year old, Middle Paleolithic occupation of a Jordanian rockshelter. The research, centering on the spatial analysis of artifacts, hearths and related data, reveals how the Archaic occupants of the shelter structured their activities and placed certain conceptual labels on different parts of the site. The structure of Tor Faraj is compared to site structures defined for modern foragers, in both ethnographic and archaeological contexts, to measure any differences in behavioral organization. The comparisons show very similar structures for Tor Faraj and its modern cohorts. The implications of this finding challenge prevailing views in the emergence of modern human controversy in which Archaic groups are thought to have had inferior cognition and less complex behavioral-social organization than modern foragers. And, it is generally thought that such behaviors only emerged after the appearance of the Upper Paleolithic, dated some 10-20,000 years later than the occupation of Tor Faraj.},

Repatriation requests have successfully secured the return of many ancestral remains, but the act of repatriation does not always lead to a lasting legacy of friendship and continued collaboration. The University of Birmingham and the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa worked together to build a bridge that allowed collaborative work to continue beyond the formal handover ceremony of M\"aori ancestors in 2013. The bridge was built by mutual respect, increased levels of understanding and willingness to cooperate for the good of both parties through the handover ceremony. From the university's perspective, the act of repatriation was a moral duty, providing an opportunity to address colonial attitudes that had led to the collection and retention of the ancestors. From Te Papa's perspective, the formal handover ceremony provided an opportunity to show respect to the ancestors in an appropriate and culturally sensitive way.},

  abstract = {The question of Paleolithic group size has been addressed by scholars in many disciplines applying different methods. In our study we apply a novel analytical approach in an attempt to assess the group size of hominins that occupied the Acheulian site of Gesher Benot Ya'aqov, Israel (GBY). Within this framework, we subjected the handaxe assemblages from several archaeological horizons at the site to a morpho-technological analysis. The analysis combined high-resolution three-dimensional geometric morphometric analysis with typo-technological attribute analysis to assess the inter- and intraassemblage morpho-technological variability. The analysis was also applied to an experimental handaxe assemblage produced by an expert knapper. The results of the analysis show high morphological homogeneity coupled with high technological variability in each of the archaeological assemblages. This pattern is highly indicative of the work of expert knappers, as is also suggested by the comparison between the archaeological and experimental assemblages. The high density of archaeological remains in some of the GBY occupations and their pristine taphonomic condition provide additional support for the involvement of large groups of hominins, although some horizons are far poorer in archaeological remains and hence do not allow such an interpretation. Nevertheless, the fact that in all assemblages the handaxes show the same techno-morphological pattern indicates that they were all produced by expert knappers. As shown by numerous models and ethnographic data, the presence of experts can be viewed as an indication of large and socially complex societies. Thus, although some of the GBY occupations were not formed by large groups, the smaller groups whose activities are recorded were very likely to be part of larger, socially complex cultural groups. This variability in occupational intensity is interpreted as representing an aggregation-dispersal mechanism, similar to those documented in many huntergatherer societies.},

She emphasizes microdebitage as the most reliable indicator of workshop location. Her argument is supported by the use of ethnoarchaeological accounts of debitage deposition from stone- and glass-artifact manufacture. Our alternative view is that microdebitage is only one of several criteria for identifying the loci of intensive stone-tool making. The Colh\'a data are also used to demonstrate variability in behaviors related to the formation of debitage deposits and the visibility of workshop activity. We contend that identifying precise manufacturing loci is less important than assessing the overall scale of production at a site and that site"s role in regional settlement systems.
          , 
            Moholy-Nagy (1990) ha argumentado que las concentraciones de desechos de piedra pulida en sitios mesoamericanos, incluyendo Colh\'a, representan basureros y no talleres como hemos sugerido (Shafer y Hester 1983, 1986). Ella ha puesto \'enfasis en los microdesechos como los indicadores m\'as confiables de los sitios de talleres. Su disputa es apoyada por el uso de relatos etnoarqueol\'ogicos de la disposici\'on de desechos de fabricaci\'on de artefactos de piedra y vidrio volc\'anico. Nuestro punto de vista es que la presencia de microdesechos es solamente uno de los varios criterios para identificar lugares de fabricaci\'on intensiva de herramientas de piedra. Los datos de Colh\'a tambi\'en se usan para demostrar la variabilidad en los comportamientos y la visibilidad de las actividades de taller. Argumentamos que la identificaci\'on precisa de los lugares de fabricaci\'on es menos importante que la evaluaci\'on de la escala general de la producci\'on en un sitio y el papel de ese sitio en sistemas regionales de asentamiento.},

Various spatio-temporal covariance models have been implemented, such as the separable, product-sum, metric and sum-metric models. In a real-world application we compare spatiotemporal interpolations using these models with a purely spatial kriging approach. The target variable of the application is the daily mean PM10 concentration measured at rural air quality monitoring stations across Germany in 2005. R code for variogram fitting and interpolation is presented in this paper to illustrate the workflow of spatio-temporal interpolation using gstat. We conclude that the system works properly and that the extension of gstat facilitates and eases spatio-temporal geostatistical modelling and prediction for R users.},

  abstract = {Based upon an earlier study of innovation and the transmission and acquisition of innovative skills and knowledge among Aka forager adolescents of central Africa, this study examines the same topic among Chabu adolescents of southwestern Ethiopia, a forager-farming society. Research with the Aka foragers questioned several evolutionary predictions about who should innovate and how innovations should be transmitted (i.e., adolescents, males in particular, should be more innovative than children and adults, innovations should spread by horizontal transmission, and adolescents should pay particular attention to prestigious, ``successful'' peers). In-depth and structured interviews, informal observations, and systematic ranking and sorting techniques with 14 Chabu adolescents and seven adults were utilized in this study. Major results in terms of the processes and modes of social learning suggest that: (1) oblique modes of transmission were exhibited with greater frequency than horizontal, while prestige bias was indirectly important and linked to reproductive efforts and (2) direct teaching was very important but not exclusively utilized as a means of transmitting social knowledge and reflective of the complexity of skills being taught. Additional results indicate that as with the Aka data, (3) cultural terms specific to innovation existed, (4) innovations and innovators were easily identified by adolescents, (5) innovators were actively sought out individuals who exhibited pro-social qualities and were ``good teachers,'' and (6) adults were more often identified by the adolescents to be innovators. One result was inconsistent with the Aka study: Chabu adult females were more likely to be identified as innovators than were adult males. As the Chabu women produce highly valued and desired pottery with innovative designs, which sell well at the local market, these data suggest that innovative gender bias is domain dependent.},

  abstract = {Cognitive psychologists indicate that teaching, language, and accurate imitation are distinct features of human cognition that enable rapid and precise acquisition of cultural beliefs and practices. This chapter examines two of the three proposed cognitive mechanisms that hypothetically enabled pronounced cultural diversity and complexity\textemdash teaching and accurate imitation. Both are either rare or do not exist in great apes but are hypothesized by researchers to be part of human nature and therefore universal. A limitation of most existing studies on these topics is that they have been conducted with Western children in laboratory settings. No studies on these topics have been conducted with active hunter-gatherers. This chapter describes two systematic studies with Aka hunter-gatherers of the Central African Republic. Videotapes of Aka 1-year-olds in naturalistic settings are used to evaluate whether or not one type of teaching, called natural pedagogy (NP), exists among foragers. The second study uses a standardized puzzle box with 4- to 7-year-old children to consider whether or not one form of accurate imitation, called overimitation, occurs at this age among the Aka, as it does among 90 \% of Western children. Aka data supported the natural pedagogy hypothesis, but found that natural pedagogy was shaped by cultural context and that many other forms of teaching existed in infancy. The overimitation study questioned the age at which it is hypothesized to emerge in human children. Most Aka children used emulation rather than overimitation with the puzzle box, while most Aka adults used overimitation. Again, hunter-gatherer cultural context is suggested to impact the timing of its emergence in human development.},

Until recently, this technocomplex was found exclusively in northeastern Africa; however, archaeological surveys conducted across the Arabian Peninsula in the last decade have expanded the known distribution of this technological phenomenon. Since 2009, researchers from separate archaeological missions have mapped sites yielding Nubian cores and debitage, and by extension Nubian technology, in the southern, central and northernmost parts of the Arabia Peninsula. Nubian Complex artifacts in central and southern Arabia were made using different raw materials: in Al-Kharj (central Saudi Arabia) Middle Paleolithic industries were made exclusively on quartzite, while in Dhofar (southern Oman) chert was the only knappable material available for use. Given these differences, we sought to examine the influence of raw material variability on core morphology and size. Contrary to initial hypothesis, this study finds that the differences recorded are not a function of raw material properties. In both areas, Nubian cores were reduced using the same technological systems producing a set of preferential blanks. Rather, the recorded differences from raw material constrains were primarily due to knapping accidents, which occur in higher proportions at quartzite-based assemblages from Al-Kharj (specifically the siret fracture) compared with the chert assemblages from Dhofar. In sum, we argue that raw material had little effect on Nubian Levallois core technology and was not a constraint on Nubian Complex artisans.},

The last two generations are observed some 50 m above the modern lakes' level; they are respectively attributed to the beginning of the last interglacial and to the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. Analysis of the morphology and texture of the stromatolites reveals an ecological zonation between 0 and 10\textendash 14 m below the shoreline. Their relatively high {$\delta$}18O and {$\delta$}13C values reflect a long residence time for the paleolake water, which would have been favorable to the establishment of an isotopic equilibrium between atmospheric CO2 and the dissolved inorganic carbon, despite deep carbon inputs in relation to carbonititic volcanism. A study of the 18O, 2H and 13C contents in the hydrothermal springs, perennial rivers and lacustrine brines indicates that, during the last period of significant renewal of the deep saline groundwater, precipitation was depleted in heavy isotopes when compared to modern precipitation. This difference corresponds to a drop of about 600\textendash 1000 m in altitudinal ``hydroclimatic'' zones. Finally, a comparison between the modern and paleohydrological data leads us to believe that the stabilization of the paleolake shorelines at the same altitude can be attributed to control by the water table level in the aquifer of the basaltic plateaus east of the basin.},

  abstract = {Although scientists are aware that humans share the same biological heritage as do all other organisms on the planet, the reliance of Homo sapiens on culture and cooperation has resulted in what can best be described as ``a spectacular evolutionary anomaly.''1:11 The extra-somatic adaptations, technological dominance, and success of our species in colonizing every terrestrial habitat have no parallel.2 Moreover, Homo sapiens accounts for about eight times as much biomass as do all other terrestrial wild vertebrates combined,3 an amount equivalent to the biomass of all 14,000+ species of ants,4 the most successful terrestrial invertebrates. Human societies are complex, with more specialized economic niches in the United States than the total number of mammalian species on the planet.5 While some might suggest that only post-industrial humans achieved stunning biological success, data suggest that humans living as hunter-gatherers would have attained a world population of more than 70 million individuals6 and a total biomass greater than that of any other large vertebrate on the planet if agriculture had not been repeatedly invented as they spread.},

  title = {Historians and {{Historical Databases}}},
  year = {2019},
  month = nov,
  abstract = {In recent days there was much discussion by historians on Twitter of the proper and improper uses of historical knowledge in testing social science theories. It was initially prompted by the publication of a Science article last week on historical Church exposure and global psychological variation. Most of it was quite negative (I am still reading the article and its voluminous appendices, so I reserve judgment). Some of this negative reaction spilled over to Seshat as a result of Laura Spinney's publishing yesterday a ``long read'' on Cliodynamics and the Seshat Databank in the Guardian. But such criticism can only come from those who know nothing about how Seshat works. The Seshat Project is a collaboration between historians, archaeologists, and social scientists. Historians play key roles in all phases of building the Databank. Two out of five members of the core group have PhDs in History. Historians are involved in the workshops in which we develop conceptual scheme for translating knowledge about past societies into data; they consult Seshat research assistants and check Seshat data, and they fully participate in writing the resulting articles. Seshat articles typically have dozens of authors (in two cases over 50), most of them historians. Seshat would be impossible without such intense collaboration between scientists and humanities scholars. You can read more about how Seshat operates in ``An Introduction to Seshat: Global History Databank,'' in press in~Journal of Cognitive History~(SocArXiv Preprint). Collaboration between scientists and humanists requires a lot more work than other interdisciplinary projects. The ``two cultures'' are often motivated by different research interests and goals, and use very different methodologies and languages. This is one of the reasons why Seshat spent such a long time in gestation (the project was launched in 2011, but the first article fully utilizing Seshat data was published only in early 2018). Our multi-authored articles go through innumerable iterations before the co-authors, coming from very different research traditions, can arrive on mutually intelligible and agreeable texts. This is a stiff price, but well-worth paying. Seshat goals also reflect the diversity of motivations of the project participants. As a scientist I am primarily motivated by using the rich knowledge, possessed by the scholars of the past, in testing scientific theories about how human societies evolve over time. But over the last three decades I read and enjoyed thousands of books and articles by specialist historians and archaeologists, who delve into the intricate inner working of past human societies. Such knowledge is fascinating to me because of its intrinsic worth, irrespective of whether we capture it in the Databank. Initially I thought that only a small fraction of historians would be interested in the Seshat data. I am happy to report that I was wrong. In fact, most historians we approach get involved. The degree of involvement varies. Some help us with identifying good general sources and answer a few questions. Others write detailed narratives and code datasheets with hundreds of variables. Most find a comfortable level of involvement somewhere in between. Furthermore, many historians are interested not only in studying a particular society, or a segment of it, at a particular time (which is a very worthwhile and important), but also care about comparative history. Seshat allows one to start in a particular society at a particular time and focus on a particular aspect of it, and then ``travel'' back and forth in time, or in space, or in the conceptual space of different variables. It's like ``comparative history on steroids.'' Thus, Seshat is not only a vehicle for testing scientific theories, it is also a great informational resource both for the scholars of the past and (eventually) for general public. We are currently working on implementing features in the Databank that would make travel in time, geographical space, and conceptual space effortless. And Seshat publications are not limited to articles in scientific journals. We also produce ``Analytic Narratives'', formalized verbal accounts focusing on multiple in-depth case studies. The first such narrative, Seshat History of the Axial Age, will be published in early December, and two more are in the works. In closing, I want to reiterate that Seshat is far from being a threat to History. Seshat depends on the work of countless professional historians who are contributing to a remarkable store of knowledge about the human past. It also builds on and expands comparative history, which has been what historians have done ever since Polybius and Ibn Khaldun. Seshat also allows us to test various theories about the functioning and dynamics of past societies proposed by historians, archaeologists, anthropologists, and economists. By doing that, the Databank increases our understanding of how present-day societies work. And perhaps it will even enable us to change our societies so that they coul deliver better human well-being. The last is not certain, but we will not know whether it is possible until we try.},

The first part of the analysis involves using formal network methods to chart the changing interactions between humans and things at these sites through time. The values of betweenness and centrality vary through time in ways that illuminate the known transformations at the site as, for example, domestic cattle are introduced. The ego networks for houses across four time periods at the two sites are also patterned in ways that contribute to an understanding of social and economic trends. In a second set of analyses, formal network methods are applied to intersecting operational chains, or chainworks. Finally, the dependencies between humans and things are evaluated by exploring the costs and benefits of particular material choices relative to larger entanglements.

Brooches from an Iron Age site in Switzerland (Miinsingen) were chosen for analysis for two reasons: they show variation over a typically wide range of attributes, and their archaeological context, in rich associations in a horizontally stratified cemetery, provides independent evidence to check the significance of any proposed classifications. A further control on results was provided by an 'intuitive' classification of the brooches by professional archaeologists. The brooches were described numerically by quantitative and qualitative characters, and a similarity coefficient was computed between each pair. These coefficients were then submitted to two forms of cluster analysis (single- and average-link) and to a multi-dimensional scaling procedure. The average-link, but not the single-link, cluster analysis and the multi-dimensional scaling procedure were found to produce classifications of demonstrable archaeological significance.},

  abstract = {The complexity of hunter-gatherer technology has been measured by counting artifact parts or production steps. There are a variety of alternative approaches to the measurement of artifact or system complexity. If technological complexity is assumed to reflect the complexity of the problem (or amount of entropy reduction) that the artifact is designed to address, the most appropriate measure of technological complexity is functional design complexity, which entails application of the entropy formula from information theory to the making and using of an artifact and the results obtained by its use. Functional complexity is related to structural or hierarchical complexity, because the entropy formula can be represented as a hierarchy (or stepby-step reduction of entropy) and the functional differentiation is related to the structural differentiation of an artifact. Another approach to hunter-gatherer technological complexity entails definition of a class of Bcomplex artifacts\^ on the basis of general design characteristics (e.g., incorporation of moving parts). The most structurally and functionally complex artifacts are those that possess multiple states, either through changes in the physical relationship between parts (or sub-parts) during use or through structural differentiation. Although functional complexity is difficult to measure, structural or hierarchical complexity may be measured\textemdash and multiple-state artifacts may be counted\textemdash with adequate ethnographic and archaeological data on hunter-gatherer technology.},

  abstract = {Prior work finds a diversity paradox: diversity breeds innovation, and yet, underrepresented groups that diversify organizations have less successful careers within them. Does the diversity paradox hold for scientists as well? We study this by utilizing a near-population of \textasciitilde 1.2 million US doctoral recipients from 1977-2015 and following their careers into publishing and faculty positions. We use text analysis and machine learning to answer a series of questions: How do we detect scientific innovations? Are underrepresented groups more likely to generate scientific innovations? And are the innovations of underrepresented groups adopted and rewarded? Our analyses show that underrepresented groups produce higher rates of scientific novelty. However, their novel contributions are devalued and discounted: e.g., novel contributions by gender and racial minorities are taken up by other scholars at lower rates than novel contributions by gender and racial majorities, and equally impactful contributions of gender and racial minorities are less likely to result in successful scientific careers than for majority groups. These results suggest there may be unwarranted reproduction of stratification in academic careers that discounts diversity's role in innovation and partly explains the underrepresentation of some groups in academia.},

  abstract = {Building on the body of work regarding the concepts of invention and innovation in lithic technology, we further explore the give-and-take relationship between people and their technologies in two different stone point knapping traditions. From the socio-technical framework perspective, which is one amongst many ways to look at technological trends, the acceptance and stabilisation of a tool-making tradition is not only dictated by its technology-specific properties, such as its ingenuity or usefulness. Instead, it also depends on the social conventions and practices of its spatiotemporal context, which can be explored through the notions of introduction, closure, stabilisation, destabilisation and copying. We explain the theory behind the socio-technical framework with modern examples, such as bicycle use in late nineteenth century England and electrical guitar trends in the last half of the twentieth century. Turning our attention to stone point knapping, we use Australian Kimberley point production during the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries to bridge into how the socio-technical framework reflects in the dynamics that might be involved in lithic traditions. Using this theoretical framework to think about aspects of deep-time point production, such as that recorded from the Still Bay techno-complex during the Middle Stone Age in southern Africa, becomes trickier though. Instead of reliable ethno-historical accounts or dense archaeological context, we have to rely on coarse-grained data sets about distribution, age, environment and population, making inferences more speculative and less testable. In the context of this special volume, we suggest, however, that a socio-technical framework approach may be a useful tool to enhance our thinking about dynamics in ancient techno-behaviours and that more work is necessary to flesh out its potential in this respect.},

The earliest lithic assemblages, 14,000 to 13,000 calibrated years B.P., at Healy Lake (Chindadn complex) and Swan Point (East Beringian tradition) are distinguished by the presence of microblade and burin technology reminiscent of Dyuktai culture; whereas, the earliest assemblages at Broken Mammoth (Zone 4) and the Mead site lack evidence for this technology. All of these early assemblages are incorporated into an interval called the Beringian Period, at which time a land connection existed between Alaska and Siberia. A similar pattern is exhibited for assemblages dating between about 13,000 and 9500 calibrated years B. P. (the Transitional Period), i.e., Healy Lake, Swan Point, and Gerstle River have microblade and burin technology assigned to the Denali complex, while Broken Mammoth (Zone 3) and Mead do not. Recovered fauna (e.g., elk, bison, small mammals, and birds) show a broad-based economic strategy during both periods. Sample size, seasonally, and site specific activities are explored as possible explanations for the differences among these lithic assemblages.},

Yet Acheulian industries are widely seen as having remained essentially unchanged for some 1.3 million years or more. In reality, however, although the Acheulian did not develop in a cumulative or directional manner over its long history, it nevertheless displayed considerable levels of typological and technological diversity and variability at continental, regional, and local levels. It is at the local level that this variability is at its greatest, with prepared core technologies regarded as characteristic of the succeeding Middle Paleolithic and Middle Stone Age appearing sporadically and ephemerally in the Acheulian. It is our contention that this pattern of local, short term variability combined with global long term stasis cannot be accounted for by models asserting that the hominin makers of the Acheulian lacked the cognitive capabilities of their evolutionary successors. Instead, we argue that Acheulian hominins were cognitively capable of innovative technical behavior and often displayed it; but that, despite structural life history parameters that approached those of living Homo sapiens, relatively short childhood, juvenile, and adolescence phases, combined with small local group size, constrained the social and developmental scope for innovation. Furthermore, we argue that metapopulation-level social, demographic, and ecological dynamics in the Acheulian, relating to group size, foraging ranges, and levels of individual migration, served to limit the lifespan of local groups and thereby reduced the likelihood of innovative behaviors disseminating through social networks and becoming fixed in cultural repertoires before the originator population became extinct. We explore the idea that the transition from the Acheulian to the ensuing Middle Paleolithic and Middle Stone Age was therefore driven not by evolutionary developments in hominin cognitive capacities, but by changes in life history and metapopulation factors.},

  abstract = {This study explored whether the tendency of chimpanzees and children to use emulation or imitation to solve a tool-using task was a response to the availability of causal information. Young wild-born chimpanzees from an African sanctuary and 3- to 4-year-old children observed a human demonstrator use a tool to retrieve a reward from a puzzle-box. The demonstration involved both causally relevant and irrelevant actions, and the box was presented in each of two conditions: opaque and clear. In the opaque condition, causal information about the effect of the tool inside the box was not available, and hence it was impossible to differentiate between the relevant and irrelevant parts of the demonstration. However, in the clear condition causal information was available, and subjects could potentially determine which actions were necessary. When chimpanzees were presented with the opaque box, they reproduced both the relevant and irrelevant actions, thus imitating the overall structure of the task. When the box was presented in the clear condition they instead ignored the irrelevant actions in favour of a more efficient, emulative technique. These results suggest that emulation is the favoured strategy of chimpanzees when sufficient causal information is available. However, if such information is not available, chimpanzees are prone to employ a more comprehensive copy of an observed action. In contrast to the chimpanzees, children employed imitation to solve the task in both conditions, at the expense of efficiency. We suggest that the difference in performance of chimpanzees and children may be due to a greater susceptibility of children to cultural conventions, perhaps combined with a differential focus on the results, actions and goals of the demonstrator.},

In addition, the domestication of cattle and pig in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic \cyrchar\CYRS{} is discussed as is the development of pastoral economies in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic C/Pottery Neolithic, when caprine herds were first introduced into the eastern and southern desertic regions. Other issues raised are the possible processes involved in domesticating animals, the problem of autochthonous domestication versus the introduction of domesticates into the region and the influence of the unique physical conditions of the southern Levant on the domestication process.},

We then suggest important avenues for further investigation, including the historiography of Pacific archaeology, diverse national and linguistic traditions, international linkages between scholars and practitioners, pre-World War II excavations, theories about trans-Pacific contacts, and the often-hidden importance of women and Indigenous scholars and interlocutors in the field. Each of these themes is addressed by one or more of the papers in this special issue.},

Concerted evolution is normally used to describe parallel changes at different sites in a genome, but it is also observed in languages where a specific phoneme changes to the same other phoneme in many words in the lexicon\textemdash a phenomenon known as regular sound change. We develop a general statistical model that can detect concerted changes in aligned sequence data and apply it to study regular sound changes in the Turkic language family.
Results
Linguistic evolution, unlike the genetic substitutional process, is dominated by events of concerted evolutionary change. Our model identified more than 70 historical events of regular sound change that occurred throughout the evolution of the Turkic language family, while simultaneously inferring a dated phylogenetic tree. Including regular sound changes yielded an approximately 4-fold improvement in the characterization of linguistic change over a simpler model of sporadic change, improved phylogenetic inference, and returned more reliable and plausible dates for events on the phylogenies. The historical timings of the concerted changes closely follow a Poisson process model, and the sound transition networks derived from our model mirror linguistic expectations.
Conclusions
We demonstrate that a model with no prior knowledge of complex concerted or regular changes can nevertheless infer the historical timings and genealogical placements of events of concerted change from the signals left in contemporary data. Our model can be applied wherever discrete elements\textemdash such as genes, words, cultural trends, technologies, or morphological traits\textemdash can change in parallel within an organism or other evolving group.},

Cognitive-related prerequisites for this technological capability are innovative behaviour and the faithful inter-generational transmission and maintenance of tool designs by accurate social learning processes. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that a complex of morphological and behavioural adaptations specifically for tool skills is also required. In a novel analysis we compared the tool-associated adaptive patterns in Homo erectus and the New Caledonian crow. Both species provide the most convincing early Homo and nonhuman evidence, respectively, for the making of cumulatively modified tools. We identified probable shared traits in H. erectus and the New Caledonian crow that include morphological adaptations specifically for enhanced tool manipulation and a significant component of daily diet from hunting and/or processing animal food with tools. We propose that a tool-using lifestyle based on animal food that confers a reproductive advantage and evolves enhanced tool manipulation skills, together with appropriate innovative ability and social learning processes, may be essential for cumulative modification of tool designs.},

A new suite of radiocarbon dates from stratigraphic excavations at Anakena and ``chronometric hygiene'' analysis of earlier radiocarbon determinations reveals little reliable evidence for a longer chronology. In this paper we present additional lines of evidence in support of a shorter chronology: lake-core evidence for vegetation change and fire history, stratigraphic studies of deforestation and soil erosion, the results of obsidian hydration dating, and considerations of East Polynesian chronologies. The current evidence is best explained by a colonization date for Rapa Nui of about AD 1200. We briefly outline implications of the shorter chronology.},

Reanalysis of radiocarbon dates for the region show that migrations into the most remote Pacific occurred just over 1000\textendash 800 years ago, proceeded more rapidly than previously held, and included dispersal of plants and animals that invaded and disrupted unique and fragile island biotas. Human impacts profoundly transformed pristine ecosystems with habitat loss, the impacts of invasive rats, dogs, and pigs, as well as human predation. Successful human colonization led to natural environments transformed into agriculturally productive systems.},

  abstract = {On the western edge of Lake Natron, Tanzania, the lower Pleistocene lacustrine series contains some stromatolitic layers which are mainly composed of fluorite rather than calcium carbonate, as is the case with most stromatolites. Moreover in the uppermost part of some layers, fluorite is replaced by dolomite, but preserving the petrographic texture. The uppermost part of the section (around 50 m above the present lake level) is capped by calcareous stromatolitic benches which were known to delimit the ancient shorelines. These stromatolites are unaltered. The composition of the stromatolitic bodies seems to be controlled by the lake chemistry, which is in turn related to the lake volume. Chemical variations of the lake water might reflect the lake level changes resulting from climatic oscillations and be recorded in the mineral composition of the stromatolites, and therefore provides a paleoenvironmental record of lake water composition as the lake was changing from a large freshwater lake to a playa-lake similar to the present Lake Natron. Our results illustrate depositional and diagenetic processes that may occur in alkaline environments such as possible pseudomorphism of the calcium carbonates, origin of the fluorite-ore and dolomitization.},

  abstract = {This study evaluates the hypothesis that some documented cases of long-distance sea crossing by the Late Pleistocene Homo sapiens occurred as a result of accidental drifting, rather than by intentional seafaring. For that purpose, we use an existing computer simulation framework, with some modifications, to investigate the likelihood that a planned or unplanned island colonization by a small group of individuals will persist to establish a viable population. Within the original framework, planned colonization was operationally characterized as being initiated by equal numbers of unrelated young men and women, whereas for unplanned colonization, those who migrate inadvertently were regarded in effect as a random sample of the whole population. Here, we consider a different scenario for unplanned colonization, which we believe is more relevant to sea crossing by the Late Pleistocene humans, that is, we assume that unplanned colonization occurs when members of households on watercrafts with limited voyaging capabilities are drifted away by ocean currents and washed up on a distant island. We also extend the previous analysis by considering a broader range of combinations of fertility and mortality schedules that individuals are assumed to follow. Our simulations suggest the following: (1) colonization of an island by ten or fewer unrelated young men and women can be successful within the feasible range of fertility and mortality levels; (2) in comparison, the likelihood of success for unplanned colonization is considerably smaller for the same range of fertility and mortality levels; and (3) there exists a small range of parameter combinations for which unplanned colonization has a non-negligible prospect of success even without assuming recurrent accidental drifts to the same island, and thus, the accidental colonization scenario cannot be totally excluded. In addition, we find that the minimum founding population required for successful colonization varies substantially depending on the fertility and mortality levels.},

As imitation is central to social learning, the imitative processes in which children learn skills and acquire knowledge are described and discussed. The San children learn life skills through their play, and these are transmitted not by adults but mainly by their playmates. Although overt instruction is very rare, older boys often help younger ones when the latter reach an impasse in making toys by, for example, taking over and completing the work. This type of helping leads to the transmission of skills and exemplifies the mutual sharing of actions in San daily life.},

  abstract = {The transition in north-west Europe from the hunteregatherer societies of the Late Mesolithic to the pioneer farming societies of the early Neolithic is not well understood, either culturally or palaeoecologically. In Britain the final transition was rapid but it is unclear whether novel Neolithic attributes were introduced by immigrants who supplanted the native hunteregatherers, or whether the latest Mesolithic foragers gradually adopted elements of the Neolithic economic package. In this study, relatively coarse- (10 mm interval) and fine-resolution (2 mm), multi-proxy palaeoecological data including pollen, charcoal and NPPs including fungi, have been used to investigate two phases of vegetation disturbance of (a) distinctly Late Mesolithic and (b) early Neolithic age, at an upland site in northern England in a region with both a Neolithic and a Late Mesolithic archaeological presence. We identify and define the palaeoecological characteristics of these two disturbance phases, about a millennium apart, in order to investigate whether differing land-use techniques can be identified and categorised as of either foraging or early farming cultures. The Late Mesolithic phase is defined by the repetitive application of fire to the woodland to encourage a mosaic of productive vegetation regeneration patches, consistent with the promotion of Corylus and to aid hunting. In this phase, weed species including Plantago lanceolata, Rumex and Chenopodiaceae are frequent, taxa which are normally associated with the first farmers. The early Neolithic phase, including an Ulmus decline, has characteristics consistent with `forest farming', possibly mainly for domestic livestock, with an inferred succession of tree girdling, fireprepared cultivation, and coppice-woodland management. Such fine-resolution, potentially diagnostic land-use signatures may in future be used to recognise the cultural complexion of otherwise enigmatic woodland disturbance phases during the centuries of the MesolithiceNeolithic transition.},

Our method takes deterministic constant time per non-zero weight, improving on the best previous approach which takes expected constant time. The samples can be used as Weighted Minhash for efficient retrieval and compression (sketching) under Jaccard or L1 metric. A method is presented for using simple data statistics to reduce the running time of hash computation by two orders of magnitude. We compare our method with the random projection method and show that it has better characteristics for retrieval under L1. We present a novel method of mapping hashes to short bit-strings, apply it to Weighted Minhash, and achieve more accurate distance estimates from sketches than existing methods, as long as the inputs are sufficiently distinct. We show how to choose the optimal number of bits per hash for sketching, and demonstrate experimental results which agree with the theoretical analysis.},

The results show that while the Pava'ia'i site was a production site for adzes, the Tafuna site was both a production and reproduction site for adzes and scrapers. This suggests that the basalt-tool production system was diverse and multi-dimensional.},

  abstract = {The single grain optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) chronology for the sedimentary deposit at Diepkloof Rockshelter, reported by Jacobs et al. (2008c), has recently been critiqued and several reasons proposed for why the OSL ages for the Intermediate and Early Howieson's Poort (HP) and Still Bay (SB) techno-complexes might be inaccurate. Tribolo et al. (2013) presented a series of OSL and thermoluminescence (TL) ages that were in agreement with each other, but, for some part of the sequence at least, were much older than the OSL chronology of Jacobs et al. (2008c). In this paper, we have tested the criticisms of Tribolo et al. (2013) and colleagues related to both the equivalent dose (De) estimates and the beta dose rates by performing a series of targeted experiments, combined with updates and reassessments of our error calculations. We show that the De estimates are stable over a range of alternative measurement conditions and also over time. We also demonstrate the reproducibility of our measurement procedures for the beta dose rates, and their accuracy tested against a range of independently obtained estimates. We show that, for the stratigraphic units (SUs) where there are major discrepancies in age between Jacobs et al. (2008c) and Tribolo et al. (2013)dnotably the Intermediate HP and Early HPdand for which both studies had single grain OSL ages, the estimation of potassium (K) in the sediment surrounding the dated grains is critical. We provide new and updated De and dose rate estimates, and final ages which we compare with our previous age estimates and those of Tribolo et al. (2013). The differences in the size of the errors associated with the ages reported in the two independent studies are also addressed. We can show that our ages are robust and consistent with the original chronology, but we cannot satisfactorily explain why the TL and OSL ages provided by Tribolo et al. (2013) might be wrong. So, the dating conundrum at Diepkloof Rockshelter remains. As a result, we caution against the development of HP and SB age models based on only one of the chronologies for this site. At this stage, extrapolation of the Tribolo et al. (2013) chronology to a re-interpretation of the southern African MSA would appear to be premature, especially as the ages do not differ systematically between the two studies and as differences between TL and OSL ages are not an issue at other sites in southern Africa where both dating methods have been applied. Further work is needed to resolve the question of the Diepkloof chronology.},

Ages have been obtained for 30 samples from the Middle Stone Age and from sterile geological deposits at the base and top of the sediment sequence. The ages for all the archaeological units have been obtained from single-grain measurements that enable unrepresentative grains to be rejected after they have been scrutinized for their OSL behavior. The shape of the equivalent dose distribution and the degree of spread in equivalent dose for each sample have also been scrutinized for evidence of depositional and postdepositional effects that can influence the accuracy of the age estimates. This study also used the same systematic approach as that used for the dating of the Howieson's Poort and Still Bay in South Africa. This single-grain approach results in more accurate and precise age estimates that place all ages measured and analyzed in this way on a common timescale. Four periods of human occupation have been dated to w162 ka, w125 ka, w110 ka, and w99e91 ka during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 6, 5e, 5d, and 5c, respectively. Occupation of the site appears to have occurred at periods of higher sea level and increased aeolian activity, and the cave was ultimately sealed by the accumulation of a large dune w90 ka ago that infilled the cave, but also blanketed the cliff face above the cave, thus preventing further habitation of the site until w39 ka.},

  abstract = {Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) measurements were made on individual, sand-sized grains of quartz from Middle Palaeolithic deposits at two cave sites (El Harhoura 2 and El Mnasra) on the Atlantic coast of Morocco. We were able to calculate OSL ages for 32 of the 33 samples collected from the Middle Palaeolithic deposits, including the earliest and latest Aterian levels at both sites. These ages reveal periods of occupation between about 110 and 95 ka (thousands of years ago), and at w75 ka. A late Middle Palaeolithic occupation of El Harhoura 2 is also recorded at w55 ka. Our single-grain OSL chronologies largely support previous age estimates from El Mnasra and other sites along the Atlantic coast of Morocco, but are generally more precise, reproducible and stratigraphically more coherent (i.e., fewer age reversals). We compare the single-grain ages for El Harhoura 2 and El Mnasra with those obtained from single- and multi-grain OSL dating of Middle Palaeolithic deposits in the nearby sites of Contrebandiers and Dar es-Soltan 1 and 2, and with records of past regional environments preserved in sediment cores collected from off the coast of northwest Africa. A conspicuous feature of the new chronologies is the close correspondence between the three identified episodes of human occupation and periods of wetter climate and expanded grassland habitat. Owing to the precision of the single-grain OSL ages, we are able to discern gaps in occupation during Marine Isotope Stages 5 and 4, which may represent drier periods with reduced vegetation cover. We propose that these climatic conditions can be correlated with events in the North Atlantic Ocean that exert a major control on abrupt, millennial-scale fluctuations between wet and dry periods in northwest and central North Africa.},

Here, an industry developed during the colonisation phase based on the exploitation of numerous sources of argillite \textendash{} a fine-grained, homogeneous rock with conchoidal fracture properties. Argillite from the Bluff and Riverton sources was a major attractor during the earliest period of human occupation and Bluff argillite adzes were distributed widely throughout the lower South Island. The most extensive sources of Bluff argillite are on Colyers Island, where there is evidence of quarrying and preform production along much of the coast. The sites on Colyers Island were surveyed as the first part of an archaeological investigation of quarrying and adze production in Bluff Harbour. The quarried boulders, outcrops and artefact distributions at these sites indicated that the raw material was exploited by highly organised and skilled craft specialists. The initial stages of adze manufacture were undertaken at the quarry, and then preforms were taken to multipurpose camp sites around the harbour for finishing. Adze blanks on Colyers Island were made from large flakes, tabular blocks and cobbles, using imported hammer stones. This paper documents the significance of Colyers Island as an important adze production complex in New Zealand.},

  abstract = {Bluff Harbour, in southern New Zealand (Murihiku), is the southernmost location of Polynesian adze production. Here, an industry developed during the colonisation phase based on the exploitation of numerous sources of argillite \textendash{} a fine-grained, homogeneous rock with conchoidal fracture properties. Argillite from the Bluff and Riverton sources was a major attractor during the earliest period of human occupation and Bluff argillite adzes were distributed widely throughout the lower South Island. The most extensive sources of Bluff argillite are on Colyers Island, where there is evidence of quarrying and preform production along much of the coast. The sites on Colyers Island were surveyed as the first part of an archaeological investigation of quarrying and adze production in Bluff Harbour. The quarried boulders, outcrops and artefact distributions at these sites indicated that the raw material was exploited by highly organised and skilled craft specialists. The initial stages of adze manufacture were undertaken at the quarry, and then preforms were taken to multipurpose camp sites around the harbour for finishing. Adze blanks on Colyers Island were made from large flakes, tabular blocks and cobbles, using imported hammer stones. This paper documents the significance of Colyers Island as an important adze production complex in New Zealand.},

  abstract = {Ungulate migrations are assumed to stem from learning and cultural transmission of information regarding seasonal distribution of forage, but this hypothesis has not been tested empirically. We compared the migratory propensities of bighorn sheep and moose translocated into novel habitats with those of historical populations that had persisted for hundreds of years. Whereas individuals from historical populations were largely migratory, translocated individuals initially were not. After multiple decades, however, translocated populations gained knowledge about surfing green waves of forage (tracking plant phenology) and increased their propensity to migrate. Our findings indicate that learning and cultural transmission are the primary mechanisms by which ungulate migrations evolve. Loss of migration will therefore expunge generations of knowledge about the locations of high-quality forage and likely suppress population abundance.},

The study of parametric optimal detection theory began in the 1930s, motivated by applications in production and defence. Today this theory, which aims to minimize a given measure of detection delay under accuracy constraints, finds applications in domains including radar, sonar, seismic activity, global positioning, psychological testing, quality control, communications and power systems engineering. This paper reviews developments in optimal detection theory and sequential analysis, including sequential hypothesis testing and change-point detection, in both Bayesian and classical (non-Bayesian) settings. For clarity of exposition, we work in discrete time and provide a brief discussion of the continuous time setting, including recent developments using stochastic calculus. Different measures of detection delay are presented, together with the corresponding optimal solutions. We emphasize the important role of the signal-to-noise ratio and discuss both the underlying assumptions and some typical applications for each formulation., This article is part of the themed issue `Energy management: flexibility, risk and optimization'.},

  abstract = {The most significant change in hunter-gatherer studies has been the shift from expecting hunter-gatherers to have similar properties wherever they are found to recognizing that hunter-gatherer adaptations should vary along many different dimensions. Although archaeologists approach research with different goals, there is remarkable convergence in our knowledge about hunter-gatherers past and present. The ethnographic record of recent hunter-gatherers reveals enormous variation along several dimensions. The specific combinations of characteristics displayed among hunter-gatherers are not infinitely variable but cluster as distinctive ``system states'' (following Binford, Constructing frames of reference: an analytical method for archaeological theory building using ethnographic and environmental data sets, 2001) that pattern with both environmental and demographic variables at a global scale. Frames of reference based on these generalizations have implications for what archaeologists should expect for hunter-gatherers in different environmental settings, and also for how they should change over time if regional population density generally increases. Recognizing that patterns of variation at the regional scale are different from those at the global scale, I propose a hierarchical strategy for developing expectations for variation among prehistoric hunter-gatherers that can both situate the research locale with respect to global patterns of variation and acknowledge important dimensions of variation in habitat structure that are likely to condition regional variation in hunter-gatherer mobility, subsistence, and social organization.},

Adze debris differs in platform angle, various measures of thickness relative to other measures of size, and shape. Adze debris is compared with blade debris from Oturehua, Central Otago. There are very close affinities between adze reduction and the manufacture of blades from prismatic cores. Adze flaking debris with low striking platform angles is probably related to the production of adzes of lenticular section, as at Riverton, Southland. Higher platform angles are caused by reduction of quadrangular or nearquadrangular section adzes.},

They are among the few non-hominid organisms on Earth to be considered intelligent and well-known examples exist of several crow species having evolved innovative strategies and even use of tools in their search for food. The 40 Corvus species have also been successful dispersers and are distributed on most continents and in remote archipelagos.
Results: This study presents the first molecular phylogeny including all species and a number of subspecies within the genus Corvus. We date the phylogeny and determine ancestral areas to investigate historical biogeographical patterns of the crows. Additionally, we use data on brain size and a large database on innovative behaviour and tool use to test whether brain size (i) explains innovative behaviour and success in applying tools when foraging and (ii) has some correlative role in the success of colonization of islands. Our results demonstrate that crows originated in the Palaearctic in the Miocene from where they dispersed to North America and the Caribbean, Africa and Australasia. We find that relative brain size alone does not explain tool use, innovative feeding strategies and dispersal success within crows.
Conclusions: Our study supports monophyly of the genus Corvus and further demonstrates the direction and timing of colonization from the area of origin in the Palaearctic to other continents and archipelagos. The Caribbean was probably colonized from North America, although some North American ancestor may have gone extinct, and the Pacific was colonized multiple times from Asia and Australia. We did not find a correlation between relative brain size, tool use, innovative feeding strategies and dispersal success. Hence, we propose that all crows and ravens have relatively large brains compared to other birds and thus the potential to be innovative if conditions and circumstances are right.},

  abstract = {Social structure in human societies is underpinned by the variable expression of ideas about relatedness between different types of kin. We express these ideas through language in our kin terminology: to delineate who is kin and who is not, and to attach meanings to the types of kin labels associated with different individuals. Cross-culturally, there is a regular and restricted range of patterned variation in kin terminologies, and to date, our understanding of this diversity has been hampered by inadequate techniques for dealing with the hierarchical relatedness of languages (Galton's Problem). Here I use maximum-likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic comparative methods to begin to tease apart the processes underlying the evolution of kin terminologies in the Austronesian language family, focusing on terms for siblings. I infer (1) the probable ancestral states and (2) evolutionary models of change for the semantic distinctions of relative age (older/younger sibling) and relative sex (same-sex/opposite-sex). Analyses show that early Austronesian languages contained the relative-age, but not the relative-sex distinction; the latter was reconstructed firmly only for the ancestor of Eastern Malayo-Polynesian languages. Both distinctions were best characterized by evolutionary models where the gains and losses of the semantic distinctions were equally likely. A multi-state model of change examined how the relative-sex distinction could be elaborated and found that some transitions in kin terms were not possible: jumps from absence to heavily elaborated were very unlikely, as was piece-wise dismantling of elaborate distinctions. Cultural ideas about what types of kin distinctions are important can be embedded in the semantics of language; using a phylogenetic evolutionary framework we can understand how those distinctions in meaning change through time.},

  abstract = {\emph{Technology as Human Social Tradition} outlines a novel approach to studying variability and cumulative change in human technology-prominent research themes in both archaeology and anthropology. Peter Jordan argues that human material culture is best understood as an expression of social tradition. In this approach, each artifact stands as an output of a distinctive operational sequence with specific choices made at each stage in its production. Jordan also explores different material culture traditions that are propagated through social learning, factors that promote coherent lineages of tradition to form, and the extent to which these cultural lineages exhibit congruence with one another and with language history.Drawing on the application of cultural transmission theory to empirical research, Jordan develops a descent-with-modification perspective on the technology of Northern Hemisphere hunter-gatherers. Case studies from indigenous societies in Northwest Siberia, the Pacific Northwest Coast, and Northern California provide cross-cultural insights related to the evolution of material culture traditions at different social and spatial scales. This book promises new ways of exploring some of the primary factors that generate human cultural diversity in the deep past and through to the present.},

  abstract = {Bird song is the primary animal model system for cultural evolution. Longitudinal studies of bird song across many generations can provide insights into patterns and mechanisms of change in socially transmitted traits. In this study, we conducted a comparative analysis of songs of the House Finch (Haemorhous mexicanus) across an interval of 37 years (in 1975 and in 2012). Recordings from both years were collected in western Long Island, New York, which is thought to be the initial site of introduction of the House Finch around 1940 from the West Coast. Song types experienced a complete turnover during this period, although half of the syllable types were represented in both samples. Song length, frequency bandwidth and several other spectrographic features were the same in both years, and no structural features predicted recurrence of individual syllables. Consistent with the fact that our study population expanded substantially following a cultural founder effect, song and syllable sharing and similarity between individuals were lower in 2012 than in 1975, reflecting an increase in song diversity at the population level. However, in the more recent sample individual songs had fewer syllables, and were sung with less sequence stereotypy across renditions than in the earlier sample. Syllable prevalence in 2012 was associated both with complexity (as gauged by frequency excursion) and increased minimum frequency. Thus, over nearly 4 decades, Eastern House Finch songs remained structurally similar at the whole-song level, diversified between individuals, but became simpler and less consistent within an individual.},

  abstract = {Body size is a fundamental biological property of organisms, and documenting body size variation in hominin evolution is an important goal of palaeoanthropology. Estimating body mass appears deceptively simple but is laden with theoretical and pragmatic assumptions about best predictors and the most appropriate reference samples. Modern human training samples with known masses are arguably the `best' for estimating size in early bipedal hominins such as the australopiths and all members of the genus Homo, but it is not clear if they are the most appropriate priors for reconstructing the size of the earliest putative hominins such as Orrorin and Ardipithecus. The trajectory of body size evolution in the early part of the human career is reviewed here and found to be complex and nonlinear. Australopith body size varies enormously across both space and time. The pre-erectus early Homo fossil record from Africa is poor and dominated by relatively small-bodied individuals, implying that the emergence of the genus Homo is probably not linked to an increase in body size or unprecedented increases in size variation. Body size differences alone cannot explain the observed variation in hominin body shape, especially when examined in the context of small fossil hominins and pygmy modern humans., This article is part of the themed issue `Major transitions in human evolution'.},

  abstract = {The Initial Upper Paleolithic (IUP) temporally overlaps with the range expansion of Homo sapiens populations in various parts of Eurasia and is often considered a key archaeological phase for investigating behavioral changes from the Middle Paleolithic. This paper reports upon new data from IUP occupations at Wadi Aghar, a rock shelter site in the southern Levant. In combining the results of radiometric dates and lithic analyses, we clarify the chronological and cultural position of Wadi Aghar assemblages in the Levantine IUP. As for the records about mobility, on-site activities, and resource procurement behaviors, we present analyses of lithic use-wear, tool-type composition, soil micromorphology, and marine shells. The lithic analyses and the optically stimulated luminescence (and subsidiary radiocarbon) dating of the Wadi Aghar materials suggest their chronocultural position in the IUP (45e40 ka for Layers CeD1; 39e36 ka for Layer B; possibly 50 ka for Layer D2), providing the southernmost location for the IUP in Eurasia. In the Levant, Wadi Aghar represents one of the few IUP sites in the inland areas. The results also indicate that the timing and technological sequences from the IUP to the following bladelet industries differed between the inland and coastal zones, likely reflecting geographically variable adaptive behaviors and/or cultural transmissions. One of the behavioral characteristics of IUP foragers at Wadi Aghar is the procurement of remote resources, represented by the transportation of marine shells from the Red Sea: Canarium fusiforme and Canarium cf. mutabile. Whether it was a direct procurement with increased mobility or a result of intergroup exchanges, it was not part of behavioral repertoires during the late MP in the same area. This can be understood as the expansion of resource procurement range, functioning as additional buffers from risk in the semiarid environments in the inland Levant.},

Using quantitative data on several lithic techno-typological attributes, we demonstrate that there is a significant degree of variability in the Early Ahmarian between the northern and southern Levant, as previously pointed out by several researchers. In addition, we suggest that the technology similar to the southern Early Ahmarian also existed in the northern Levant, i.e., the Ksar Akil Phase 4 group (the KA 4 group), by introducing new Upper Palaeolithic assemblages from Wadi Kharar 16R, inland Syria. We then review currently available stratigraphic records and radiocarbon dates (including a new date from Wadi Kharar 16R), with special attention to their methodological background. As a result, we propose alternative chronological scenarios, including one that postulates that the southern Early Ahmarian and the KA 4 group appeared later than the northern Early Ahmarian with little or no overlap. On the basis of the alternative scenarios of chronological/geographical patterns of the Early Ahmarian variability, we propose four possible relationships between the Protoaurignacian and the Early Ahmarian, including a new scenario that the appearance of the Protoaurignacian preceded those of similar technological entities in the Levant, i.e., the southern Early Ahmarian and the KA 4 group. If the last hypothesis is substantiated, it requires us to reconsider the model of a Levantine origin of the Protoaurignacian and its palaeoanthropological implications.},

At the present time there are still ``true'' bananas and `` others''.

The Papeno`o research provides a case study of adze manufacture in a resource-rich zone of high quality raw material. A range of raw material procurement practices was used to reduce both flake blanks and prismatic basalt cores. A variety of adze types was manufactured, with Type 3A adzes dominating. There is some evidence for reworking broken preforms and, in particular, broken and finished adzes. Adze manufacture at the Putoura workshops appears to have taken place within a ritualised context and, perhaps, in close association to rites carried out at a nearby marae and simple shrine. In this way, adze production within the Papeno`o Valley may be similar to other major Eastern Polynesian production centres (e.g., Mauna Kea, Eiao) and smaller production locales (Kaho`olawe), where adze manufacture was spatially associated with ceremonial shrines and is inferred to have taken place under ritual constraints.},

Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the quarry produced a diverse range of adze types, mainly for local population needs.

  abstract = {The landscape around Langebaan Lagoon in the Western Cape of South Africa contains a rich archive of Middle and Late Pleistocene hominin behavior. Stone Age localities of all ages are abundant and present a valuable perspective on the region's settlement history. A complex pattern of land use is evident starting with an analysis of the Earlier Stone Age (ESA) collections from Anyskop combined with a review of data from Elandsfontein and Duinefontein. These Late Acheulian assemblages demonstrate an emphasis on handaxe production, the exploitation of medium and large game, and use of non-local raw materials. While seasonal pans provided water for animals and humans at these ESA localities, Anyskop is distinctive because of its hilltop setting, lacking water and direct access to game. Middle Stone Age (MSA) assemblages from Geelbek and Anyskop combined with a review of data from Hoedjiespunt, Sea Harvest and Ysterfontein provide further evidence for a regional settlement system that also incorporated non-local raw materials into the lithic provisioning strategy. Some MSA lithic technologies in the Western Cape were aimed at the production of bifacial points and blades, as well as backed elements. Subsistence strategies expanded to encompass the utilization of both terrestrial and marine resources. Although symbolic artifacts are rare from these sites, worked ochre is present at Hoedjiespunt. These behavioral patterns suggest that the Middle and Late Pleistocene hominins who left these ESA and MSA materials behind were adept masters of their environment with adaptations well suited to the West Coast landscape.},

Understanding how group-level patterns of culture emerge from individual-level behaviour is a long-standing question in the biological and social sciences. We develop a simulation model capturing demographic and cultural dynamics relevant to human cultural evolution, focusing on the interface between population-level patterns and individual-level processes. The model tracks the distribution of variants of cultural traits across individuals in a population over time, conditioned on different pathways for the transmission of information between individuals. From these data we obtain theoretical expectations for a range of statistics commonly used to capture population-level characteristics (e.g. the degree of cultural diversity). Consistent with previous theoretical work, our results show that the patterns observed at the level of groups are rooted in the interplay between the transmission pathways and the age structure of the population. We also explore whether, and under what conditions, the different pathways can be distinguished based on their group-level signatures, in an effort to establish theoretical limits to inference. Our results show that the temporal dynamic of cultural change over time retains a stronger signature than the cultural composition of the population at a specific point in time. Overall, the results suggest a shift in focus from identifying the one individual-level process that likely produced the observed data to excluding those that likely did not. We conclude by discussing the implications for empirical studies of human cultural evolution.},

Here we present a non-equilibrium neutral model which accounts for temporally varying population sizes and mutation rates and makes it possible to analyse the cultural system under consideration at any point in time. This framework gives an indication whether observed changes in the frequency distributions of a set of cultural variants between two time points are consistent with the random copying hypothesis. We find that the likelihood of the existence of the observed assemblage at the end of the considered time period (expressed by the probability of the observed number of cultural variants present in the population during the whole period under neutral evolution) is a powerful indicator of departures from neutrality. Further, we study the effects of frequency-dependent selection on the evolutionary trajectories and present a case study of change in the decoration of pottery in early Neolithic Central Europe. Based on the framework developed we show that neutral evolution is not an adequate description of the observed changes in frequency.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the relationships between social learning process through which Aari women learn to make pots, which involves a combination of observation and trial and error experimentation, and patterns of increasing diversity in pot shape, size, and style. The study has two objectives: (1) to describe the variation in Aari pot shapes, Aari classifications of pots, and changes in the process of pot making over the last hundred years and (2) to examine the relationships between the Aari potters' learning systems and technological and stylistic innovations. The research included an analysis of the learning system among female potters, focusing on the cha\^ine op\'eratoire in pottery making. Three major results emerged from the study. First, Aari people were able to identify small variances (from 2 to 3 cm) and categorize separately what are highly similar pot shapes. Second, the tila, which is the most used Aari pot, is produced in a normal distribution in terms of height and circumference. Third, potters create new shapes and sizes of pots as per the dimensions specified by customers based on special needs related to particular occasions and social contexts. Stylistic and technical diversity have both increased over the last century. The learning system used by Aari potters is centered on how the human body, specifically the hands and fingers, can create and develop new styles of pottery, almost on their own. The potters themselves know that creativity depends on the sequence of hands and finger movements used in response to the natural environment.},

  abstract = {Humans have transformed Europe's landscapes since the establishment of the first agricultural societies in the mid-Holocene. The most important anthropogenic alteration of the natural environment was the clearing of forests to establish cropland and pasture, and the exploitation of forests for fuel wood and construction materials. While the archaeological and paleoecological record documents the time history of anthropogenic deforestation at numerous individual sites, to study the effect that prehistoric and preindustrial deforestation had on continental-scale carbon and water cycles we require spatially explicit maps of changing forest cover through time. Previous attempts to map preindustrial anthropogenic land use and land cover change addressed only the recent past, or relied on simplistic extrapolations of present day land use patterns to past conditions. In this study we created a very high resolution, annually resolved time series of anthropogenic deforestation in Europe over the past three millennia by 1) digitizing and synthesizing a database of population history for Europe and surrounding areas, 2) developing a model to simulate anthropogenic deforestation based on population density that handles technological progress, and 3) applying the database and model to a gridded dataset of land suitability for agriculture and pasture to simulate spatial and temporal trends in anthropogenic deforestation. Our model results provide reasonable estimations of deforestation in Europe when compared to historical accounts. We simulate extensive European deforestation at 1000 BC, implying that past attempts to quantify anthropogenic perturbation of the Holocene carbon cycle may have greatly underestimated early human impact on the climate system.},

The Fagaloa Volcanics, the oldest of which have reverse polarity implying an age greater than 1,000,000 years, form much of Upolu and Savai'i at depth, particularly in the east. They have significantly lower void ratios and higher densities than most other rocks, due to compaction before erosion, to vesicle filling, and to deep weathering. There is thus a marked tendency for bulk density to increase with depth, made the more marked because relatively dense vitric tuffs, formed like the young Vini Tuff, by eruptions directly into the sea, are presumably more common in the lower part of the volcanic pile.},

Population size may be one such factor, with larger populations thought to be able to support more complex cultural traits. This hypothesis has been suggested by mathematical models and empirical studies of small-scale societies. However, to date there have been few experimental demonstrations of an effect of population size on cultural accumulation. Here we provide such a demonstration using a novel task, solving jigsaw puzzles. 80 participants divided into ten transmission chains solved puzzles in one of two conditions: one in which participants had access to one semi-completed puzzle from the previous generation, and the other in which participants simultaneously saw three semi-completed puzzles from the previous generation. As predicted, the mean number of pieces solved increased over time in the three-puzzle-per-generation condition, but not in the one-puzzle-per-generation condition. Thus, our experiment provides support for a hypothesized relationship between population size and cultural accumulation. In particular, our results suggest that the ability to simultaneously learn from multiple cultural models, and combine the knowledge of those multiple models, is most likely to allow larger groups to support more complex culture.},

  abstract = {Archaeologists interested in explaining changes in artifact morphology over long time periods have found it useful to create models in which the only source of change is random and unintentional copying error, or `cultural mutation'. These models can be used as null hypotheses against which to detect non-random processes such as cultural selection or biased transmission. One proposed cultural mutation model is the accumulated copying error model, where individuals attempt to copy the size of another individual's artifact exactly but make small random errors due to physiological limits on the accuracy of their perception. Here, we first derive the model within an explicit mathematical framework, generating the predictions that multiple independently-evolving artifact chains should diverge over time such that their between-chain variance increases while the mean artifact size remains constant. We then present the first experimental test of this model in which 200 participants, split into 20 transmission chains, were asked to faithfully copy the size of the previous participant's handaxe image on an iPad. The experimental findings supported the model's prediction that between-chain variance should increase over time and did so in a manner quantitatively in line with the model. However, when the initial size of the image that the participants resized was larger than the size of the image they were copying, subjects tended to increase the size of the image, resulting in the mean size increasing rather than staying constant. This suggests that items of material culture formed by reductive vs. additive processes may mutate differently when individuals attempt to replicate faithfully the size of previously-produced artifacts. Finally, we show that a dataset of 2601 Acheulean handaxes shows less variation than predicted given our empirically measured copying error variance, suggesting that other processes counteracted the variation in handaxe size generated by perceptual cultural mutation.},

  abstract = {Strong relationships between morphological and ecological characters are commonly predicted to reflect the association between form and function, with this hypothesis being well supported in restricted taxonomic and geographical contexts. Conversely, among broader sets of species, ecological variables have been shown to have limited power to explain morphological variation. To understand these apparent discrepancies, for a large and globally distributed passerine radiation, we test whether (a) the character states of four ecological variables (foraging mode, diet, strata and habitat) have different morphological optima, (b) ecological variables explain substantial variance in morphology and (c) ecological character states can be accurately predicted from morphology. We collected 10 linear morphological measurements for 782 species of corvoid passerines, and assessed (a) the fit of models of continuous trait evolution with different morphological optima for each ecological character state, (b) variation in morphological traits among ecological character states using phylogenetically corrected regressions and (c) the accuracy of morphological traits in predicting species-level membership of ecological character states using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Models of morphological evolution with different ecological optima were well supported across numerous morphological axes, corresponding with significant differences in trait distributions among ecological character states. LDA also showed that membership of the ecological categories can be predicted with relatively high accuracy by morphology. In contrast to these findings, ecological variables explain limited amounts of variation in morphological traits. For a global radiation of passerine birds, we confirm that the generation of morphological variation is generally consistent with ecological selection pressures, but that ecological characters are of limited utility in explaining morphological differences among species. Although selection towards different optima means that membership of ecological character states tend to be well predicted by morphology, the overall morphospace of individual ecological character states tend to be broad, implying that morphology can evolve in multiple ways in response to similar selection pressures. Extensive variation in morphological adaptations among similar ecological strategies is likely to be a widespread phenomenon across the tree of life.},

The well-preserved 10 m-deep deposits serve as an important reference sequence for technological and subsistence change in the Great Basin. Archaeological work started at Gatecliff in 1970 and a geochronological framework was established based on 47 uncalibrated radiocarbon (14C) dates obtained from several conventional radiometric laboratories between 1972 and 1982. These radiocarbon dates are not well accommodated within a Bayesian chronological model for these important deposits due to multiple temporal reversals and large analytical errors. This model was discarded in favor of one based on a combination of high-precision AMS 14C dates of short-lived carbonized plant remains supplemented with existing 14C dates culled from the original set using a Bayesian chronological model. Summed probabilities of the modeled posterior distributions of these 14C dates (N {$\frac{1}{4}$} 24) show episodic use of the shelter as a logistic hunting camp between 6050 and 3315 cal BP, a significant hiatus in occupation between 3315 and 2145 cal BP, and more persistent use by family bands after this time. In the future, this high-precision chronology will provide the foundation for reinterpreting broader patterns of technological and subsistence change in the Intermountain West and evaluating these changes relative to high-resolution climate records.},

Previous hypotheses concerning the evolution of such traits have focused upon the manipulation of hammerstones during stone tool production and of stone tools during their use. To date there has been no research on the manipulative pressures exerted by the non-dominant (core-holding) hand during stone tool production and its potential influence on the evolutionary history of the thumb. Here we provide the first investigation into the frequencies of digit recruitment and the relative manipulative forces experienced in the non-dominant hand during stone tool production. Eight experienced knappers produced flake cutting tools under four distinct conditions while pressure sensors, secured to the volar pads of the thumb, index and middle fingers of the non-dominant hand, recorded manipulative forces. Results indicate that relative to the fingers, the thumb was recruited significantly more frequently and experienced significantly greater manipulative forces during core repositioning events and the securing of the core during flake detachments. Our results support the hypothesis that the robust thumb anatomy observed in the hominin lineage was selected for, at least in part, as a result of more frequent and greater manipulative pressures acting upon the thumb relative to the fingers on the non-dominant hand during stone tool production.},

Despite these factors, extensive reviews of the related concepts of form and function with respect to the Lower Palaeolithic remain surprisingly sparse. We attempt to redress this issue. First we stress the historical place of form\textendash function concepts, and their role in establishing basic ideas that echo to this day. We then highlight methodological and conceptual progress in determining artefactual function in more recent years. Thereafter, we evaluate four specific issues that are of direct consequence for evaluating the ongoing relevance of form\textendash function concepts, especially with respect to their relevance for understanding human evolution more generally. Our discussion highlights specifically how recent developments have been able to build on a long historical legacy, and demonstrate that direct, indirect, experimental, and evolutionary perspectives intersect in crucial ways, with each providing specific but essential insights for ongoing questions. We conclude by emphasising that our understanding of these issues and their interaction, has been, and will be, essential to accurately interpret the Lower Palaeolithic archaeological record, tool-form related behaviours of Lower Palaeolithic hominins, and their consequences for (and relationship to) wider questions of human evolution.},

Palaeolithic archaeologists frequently investigate the Oldowan-Acheulean transition and technological developments during the subsequent million years of the Acheulean technocomplex. Here, we approach the question of why innovative stone tool production techniques occur in the Lower Palaeolithic archaeological record from an experimental biomechanical and evolutionary perspective. Nine experienced flintknappers reproduced Oldowan flake tools, `early Acheulean' handaxes, and `late Acheulean' handaxes while pressure data were collected from their non-dominant (core-holding) hands. For each flake removal or platform preparation event performed, the percussor used, the stage of reduction, the core securing technique utilised, and the relative success of flake removals were recorded. Results indicate that more heavily reduced, intensively shaped handaxes with greater volumetric controls do not necessarily require significantly greater manual pressure than Oldowan flake tools or earlier `rougher' handaxe forms. Platform preparation events do, however, require significantly greater pressure relative to either soft or hard hammer flake detachments. No significant relationships were identified between flaking success and pressure variation. Our results suggest that the preparation of flake platforms, a technological behaviour associated with the production of late Acheulean handaxes, could plausibly have been restricted prior to the emergence of more forceful precision-manipulative capabilities than those required for earlier lithic technologies.},

  abstract = {Ergonomic relationships that minimize muscle activity relative to the creation of cutting stress underpin the design of modern knives, saws, and axes. The Palaeolithic archaeological record, and the {$>$} 3 million years of technological behavior that it represents, is predominantly characterized by sharp stone implements used for cutting. To date, we do not know whether Palaeolithic hominins adhered to ergonomic principles when designing stone tools, if lithic technological transitions were linked to ease-of-use advances, or even how muscularly demanding different Palaeolithic tools are on an empirically defined relative basis. Here, we report the results of an experimental program that examines how four key stone tool types, produced between {$\sim$} 3.3 million and {$\sim$} 40 thousand years ago, influence muscle activation in the hominin upper limb. Using standardized laboratory-based tests designed to imitate Pleistocene cutting behaviors, surface electromyography recorded electrical activity (amplitude) in nine muscles across the hand, forearm and shoulder of modern humans during the use of replica Lomekwian, Oldowan, Acheulean and Mousterian stone tools. Results confirm digit flexors and abductors, particularly the first dorsal interosseous and flexor pollicis longus, to be the most heavily recruited muscles during the use of all tool types. Significant differences in muscle activation are, however, identified dependent on the type of stone tool used. Notably, the abductor digiti minimi, flexor pollicis longus, and biceps brachii were highly activated during handaxe use, particularly when compared to the use of Oldowan and Levallois flakes. Results are discussed in light of current understanding on the origin of Lower and Middle Palaeolithic technologies, why specific tool types were produced over others during these periods, and the extent to which early hominins produced ergonomically designed tools.},

Hence, it has been hypothesised that biomechanical adaptations evolved to maximise efficiency when using such tools. Here, we test experimentally whether biometric variation influences the efficiency of simple cutting tools (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 60 participants). Grip strength and handsize were measured in each participant. 30 participants used flint flakes, while the other 30 used small (unhafted) steel blades. Variations in basic parameters of tool form (length, width, thickness, cutting edge length) were recorded for the 30 flint flakes. It was ensured that mean handsize and strength in each participant group were not significantly different to investigate the effect of tool variation. The experimental task required cutting through a 10 mm-diameter hessian rope. Cutting efficiency was measured using both `Number of cutting strokes required' and `Total time taken'. Results show that both efficiency measures were significantly correlated with handsize using all 60 participants. However, no significant differences were found between the flake and blade groups in terms of mean efficiency. Nor was any significant relationship found between tool form parameters and efficiency in the flint flake group. We stress that our results do not imply that tool form has no impact on tool efficiency, but rather that e all other things being equal e biometric variation has a statistically significant influence on efficiency variation when using simple cutting tools. These results demonstrate that biomechanical parameters related directly to efficiency of use, may plausibly have been subject to selection in the earliest stone tool-using hominins.},

Controls are universally accepted as a way of ensuring reliability of experimental results used to interpret the archaeological record.

Unlike traditional approaches using stone, porcelain\textemdash while demonstrating comparable properties and fracture mechanics\textemdash can be more tightly controlled. As such, we suggest that its use ensures greater reliability in results derived from studies of tool manufacture and use and more potential for repeatability of experimental studies. A critique of previous approaches is followed by an assessment of porcelain as a suitable material for experimentation, in which two case studies that piloted the material are discussed. The first demonstrates its use in experiments regarding tool manufacture and skill. The second demonstrates its success in experiments dealing with observations of use-wear, such as projectile point impact fractures. The varied nature of these two studies aptly demonstrates the benefits of using porcelain as a controllable, moldable material.},

However, little is known from the archaeological record about the technological characteristics of Pliocene material culture, and related aspects of hominid behavior, such as habitat use and preference and subsistence of the tool makers. Expanded excavations at the West Turkana site of Lokalalei, dated to about 2{$\cdot$}35 Ma indicate that hominids making artifacts at this site had little success in striking off whole flakes from the parent core forms. The large number of scars left on these forms consists of step, hinge, and small flakes ({$>$}2 cm) which may not have been very successful in cutting or slicing, despite the fact that the raw material utilized was a medium-grained volcanic lava with observable conchoidal fracture mechanics. The fauna is characterized by mainly size 1 or 2 bovids, suggesting early access if scavenged or hunted. This lithic technology patterning, which is shared by other assemblages in the basin, suggests that the Oldowan is not the earliest stone tool technology industry. Rather, the Oldowan represents a point in a continuum from simpler Pliocene technology characterized by little understanding of stone fracture mechanics to greater technological complexity and appreciation of fracture mechanics in the Pleistocene.},

  abstract = {The Horokazawa site locality Toma (HT) is an Upper Paleolithic archeological site situated on a hillside near the Shirataki Akaishiyama obsidian source area, the largest in Japan. Excavations at HT over a period of more than 20 years have produced more than 570,000 artifacts from an area of less than 100 m2. The Horokazawa Toma lithic assemblage was characterized by the Yubetsu technique, which was used to manufacture microblades in Siberia, the Far East, and North America. The assemblage at HT has been dated to the period just after the last glacial maximum, around 15,000 years ago, and when the microblade industry was flourishing in Eastern Asia. As flakes and chips account for 98\% of the lithic artifacts, the site was evidently a lithic workshop. In this study, along with examination of excavated materials we identified the source of excavated materials by macroscopic observation and nondestructive analyses, and we experimentally replicated the manufacturing technique to analyze the activities carried at this workshop and infer the distribution network of raw materials and worked stone, beginning with the acquisition of the obsidian.},

  abstract = {This book represents an important meeting ground in the primatology field by exploring the various primate models that have been used in the reconstruction of early human behavior. While some models are based on the proposition that a key behavioral feature such as hunting, eating of seeds or monogamous mating led to the evolutionary separation of apes and humans, other models suggest that one primate species, such as the baboon or chimpanzee, best exemplifies the behavior of our early ancestors.  Several contributors to the book take the position that no single primate is a good model and contend instead that a model must be eclectic. One of the more innovative essays suggests that ancestral behavioral states can, in fact, be derived by comparing the behavior of all living hominid (ape and human) species. Additionally, several other contributors analyze and discuss the concept of model-making, noting deficiencies in earlier models while offering suggestions for future development. Although it is true that a powerful conceptual model for reconstructing hominid behavior does not yet exist, The Evolution of Human Behavior: Primate Models suggests ways one may be constructed based on behavioral ecology and evolutionary theory.},

Expanded excavations in 2005, reported here, revealed additional details of site stratigraphy, chronology and use. Initial human activity on the dune surface included exploitation of nesting or roosting seabirds, and sporadic use of combustion features. We interpret this initial phase as involving repeated, low intensity visits over a period of two to three centuries, beginning around AD 950, resulting in a palimpsest deposit (Layer III). Sometime in the 13th century intensive occupation on the dune commenced, resulting in the deposition of a cultural layer (Layer II) averaging 55\textendash 60 cm thick, containing earth ovens and with evidence for fishhook manufacture and use. Occupation of the Onemea dune ceased in the late 14th century AD. The chronology for the Onemea site, which is provided by 11 radiocarbon and three 230Th coral dates, lends support to a model of initial human colonization of southeastern Polynesia at around AD 1000.},

The relationship was fairly robust to controls for geographical region (coefficient 74\% of the original). Furthermore, it had been suggested that IQ estimates for Nigeria were spuriously low due to the country's prominent performance on Scrabble. However, when performance across all other sports were taken into account, Nigeria's performance was what one would expect based on the previously reported mean IQs near 70.},

Did our earliest ancestors engage in forms of organized violence that are appropriately viewed as approximations, forms of, or analogs for more recent forms of warfare? Assessed in this article are contrasting views that see warfare as being either a product of more recent human societies or a phenomenon with a much deeper chronology. The article provides an overview of current debates, theories, and methodological approaches, citing literature and data from archaeological, ethnographic, genetic, primatological, and paleoanthropological studies. Synthetic anthropological treatments are needed, especially in efforts to inform debates among nonacademic audiences, because the discipline's approaches are ideally suited to study the origins of warfare. Emphasized is the need to consider possible forms of violence and intergroup aggression within Pleistocene contexts, despite the methodological challenges associated with fragmentary, equivocal, or scarce data. Finally, the review concludes with an argument about the implications of the currently available data. We propose that socially cooperative violence, or ``emergent warfare,'' became possible with the onset of symbolic thought and complex cognition. Viewing emergent warfare as a byproduct of the human capacity for symbolic thought explains how the same capacities for communication and sociality allowed for elaborate peacemaking, conflict resolution, and avoidance. Cultural institutions around war and peace are both made possible by these changes. Accordingly, we suggest that studies on warfare's origins should be tied to research on the advent of cooperation, sociality, and communication.},

New explorations by the Dakhleh Oasis Project in the `Naqb el-Refuf' have relocated archaeological loci associated with water-laid tufa deposits, in order to sample these for uranium-series `dating' and to establish comparisons with Dakhleh Oasis. The age determinations on tufas at Loci IV, V and VII, and on other tufa deposits, suggest that the original geological sequence is probably over-simplified, but that the archaeological seriation is essentially correct. These determinations also indicate that the older Middle Stone Age in Dakhleh/Kharga is older than has been recognized conventionally in northern Africa ({$>$}200,000 years), and that Acheulian sensu stricto is beyond the dating-range of 400,000 years.},

  abstract = {Across the lifespan and across populations, humans `overimitate' causally unnecessary behaviors. Such irrelevant-action imitation facilitates faithful cultural transmission, but its immediate benefits to the imitator are controversial. Over short time scales, irrelevant-action imitation may bootstrap artifact exploration or interpersonal affiliation, and over longer time scales it may facilitate acquisition of either causal models or social conventions. To investigate these putative functions, we recruited community samples from two under-studied populations: Yasawa, Fiji, and Huatasani, Peru. We use a two-action puzzle box: first after a video demonstration, and again one month later. Treating age as a continuous variable, we reveal divergent developmental trajectories across sites. Yasawans (44 adults, M = 39.9 years, 23 women; 42 children, M = 9.8 years, 26 girls) resemble documented patterns, with irrelevant-action imitation increasing across childhood and plateauing in adulthood. In contrast, Huatasane\~nos (48 adults, M = 37.6 years, 33 women; 47 children, M = 9.3 years, 13 girls) evince a parabolic trajectory: adults at the site show the lowest irrelevant-action imitation of any demographic set in our sample. In addition, all age sets in both populations reduce their irrelevant actions at Time 2, but do not reduce their relevant-action imitation or goal attainment. Taken together, and considering the local cultural contexts, our results suggest that irrelevant-action imitation serves a short-term function and is sensitive to the social context of the demonstration.},

However, applications of evolutionary theory to humans predict both teaching and non-vertical transmission of culturally learned skills, behaviors, and knowledge should be common cross-culturally. Here, we review this body of theory to derive predictions about when teaching and non-vertical transmission should be adaptive, and thus more likely to be observed empirically. Using three interviews conducted with rural Fijian populations, we find that parents are more likely to teach than are other kin types, high-skill and highly valued domains are more likely to be taught, and oblique transmission is associated with high-skill domains, which are learned later in life. Finally, we conclude that the apparent conflict between theory and empirical evidence is due to a mismatch of theoretical hypotheses and empirical claims across disciplines, and we reconcile theory with the existing literature in light of our results.},

Less emphasis has been placed on the factors enabling differential persistence of villages, once formed; yet village life poses problems of social coordination. We find that data from a recently excavated Late Coalition period village on the Pajarito Plateau of New Mexico, Burnt Mesa Pueblo, exhibits less diversity in ceramic style than would be expected, if ceramic styles were ``neutral,'' using as a baseline the ceramic diversity that typifies local hamlets of the Early Coalition period. The evidence suggests that the local transmission processes affecting ceramic design were biased towards conformity (i.e., exhibit frequency-dependent bias). We take conformity in ceramic design to be one symptom of a developing social system that places great value on within-group cooperation, helping alleviate cooperative dilemmas in these early aggregates.},

Existing models of cultural evolution, inspired by models of genetic evolution, lend support to the former and do not generate trajectories that include large-scale punctuated change. We propose a simple model that can give rise to both exponential and punctuated patterns of gain and loss of cultural traits. In it, cultural innovation comprises several realistic interdependent processes that occur at different rates. The model also takes into account two properties intrinsic to cultural evolution: the differential distribution of traits among social groups and the impact of environmental change. In our model, a population may be subdivided into groups with different cultural repertoires leading to increased susceptibility to cultural loss, whereas environmental change may lead to rapid loss of traits that are not useful in a new environment. Taken together, our results suggest the usefulness of a concept of an effective cultural population size.},

  abstract = {The concept of biological diversity, or biodiversity, is at the core of evolutionary and ecological studies. Many indices of biodiversity have been developed in the last four decades, with species being one of the central units of these indices. However, evolutionary and ecological studies need a precise description of species' characteristics to best quantify inter-species diversity, as species are not equivalent and exchangeable. One of the first concepts characterizing species in biodiversity studies was abundance-based rarity. Abundance-based rarity was then complemented by trait- and phylo-based rarity, called species' trait-based and phylogenetic originalities, respectively. Originality, which is a property of an individual species, represents a species' contribution to the overall diversity of a reference set of species. Originality can also be defined as the rarity of a species' characteristics such as the state of a functional trait, which is often assumed to be represented by the position of the species on a phylogenetic tree. We review and compare various approaches for measuring originality, rarity and diversity and demonstrate that (i) even if attempts to bridge these concepts do exist, only a few ecological and evolutionary studies have tried to combine them all in the past two decades; (ii) phylo- and trait-based diversity indices can be written as a function of species rarity and originality measures in several ways; and (iii) there is a need for the joint use of these three types of indices to understand community assembly processes and species' roles in ecosystem functioning in order to protect biodiversity efficiently.},

  abstract = {Human adaptation depends upon the integration of slow life history, complex production skills, and extensive sociality. Refining and testing models of the evolution of human life history and cultural learning will benefit from increasingly accurate measurement of knowledge, skills, and rates of production with age. We pursue this goal by inferring 20 individual hunters' of hunting skill gain and loss from approximately 23,000 hunting records generated by more than 1,800 individuals at 40 locations. The model provides an improved picture of ages of peak productivity as well as variation within and among ages. The data reveal an average age of peak productivity between 30 and 35 years of age, though high skill is maintained throughout much of adulthood. In addition, there is substantial variation 25 both among individuals and sites. Within study sites, variation among individuals depends more upon heterogeneity in rates of decline than in rates of increase. This analysis sharpens questions about the co-evolution of human life history and cultural adaptation. It also demonstrates new statistical algorithms and models that expand the potential inferences drawn from detailed quantitative data collected in the field.},

  abstract = {This chapter reviews major types of statistical resampling approaches used in paleontology. They are an increasingly popular alternative to the classic parametric approach because they can approximate behaviors of parameters that are not understood theoretically. The primary goal of most resampling methods is an empirical approximation of a sampling distribution of a statistic of interest, whether simple (mean or standard error) or more complicated (median, kurtosis, or eigenvalue). This chapter focuses on the conceptual and practical aspects of resampling methods that a user is likely to face when designing them, rather than the relevant mathematical derivations and intricate details of the statistical theory. The chapter reviews the concept of sampling distributions, outlines a generalized methodology for designing resampling methods, summarizes major types of resampling strategies, highlights some commonly used resampling protocols, and addresses various practical decisions involved in designing algorithm details. A particular emphasis has been placed here on bootstrapping, a resampling strategy used extensively in quantitative paleontological analyses, but other resampling techniques are also reviewed in detail. In addition, ad hoc and literature-based case examples are provided to illustrate virtues, limitations, and potential pitfalls of resampling methods.},

A complex of newly discovered ``loess Paleolithic'' open-air sites near Yangiobod (Uzbekistan), Katta Sai, was excavated. The excavations allowed identification of a new variant of human adaptation in the regional Middle Paleolithic. In the light of the newest anthropological and genetic data, this new archaeological sites fit to the current studies on the relations between different human species during the Middle and Early Upper Paleolithic in Central Asia. Geoarchaeological investigation of the sites has shown that the Paleolithic assemblages of Katta Sai are not preserved in situ. Cultural levels suffered from rill erosion, and most of the artifacts were re-deposited by water flow, and accumulated in secondary positions on the bottom of the branched rill system. This paper aims to reconstruct the subsequent processes of the site formation and to present the complicated geological situation of the studied sites of the Katta Sai complex, with implication for the archaeological interpretation of Paleolithic assemblages of the region.},

  abstract = {The demographic success of humans compared to other closely related species is one of the remarkable stories of our evolutionary history. This can be attributed both to high fertility and improved chances of survival. But it is also fundamentally shaped by features of human parenting, cooperation, and social organization. The concept and theory of cooperative breeding combines these features and is a useful framework to consider child-rearing patterns characteristic of humans. Cooperative breeding theory was developed in biology to explain a social system found in relatively few animals in which nonparental members of a social group help to support offspring. In traditional human societies, numerous studies document that a variety of kin and nonkin of different ages and sex help mothers and contribute to infant childcare and provisioning juveniles. Cooperative breeding theory offers a well-developed theoretic and empirical context in which to evaluate cross-cultural diversity and to understand why humans cooperate in this way. This review situates humans compared to other species of cooperative breeders by outlining what we share in common and what are distinctly human aspects of parenting and childrearing. Attention is paid to both foundational research and new questions that have more recently surfaced through comparative research. Cooperative breeding is relevant to recent debates concerning the evolution of human life history, sociality, and psychology and has implications to demographic patterns, family formation, and social organization in the past as well as in today's world.},

Aboriginal people have their own world view with mythological beings who created the land. Each group has their creation stories, and they paint the important places, travels, and mythological beings on their bodies and land surface for ceremonial purposes. Since the 1970s, their paintings concerning the creation stories and their ancestral land were transformed to marketable item and became very popular as art. Especially since 1990s, many examples of transformations of art styles were observed among Aboriginal paintings. Most of them are the move to abstraction. Figurative and symbolic signs which use to dominate the canvas have disappeared and abstract expressions almost dominate the scene. Among these changes, it was always the case that there are a certain people who started to experiment the new styles to find ``the right way.'' And the newly innovated style is copied and shared among the people around the innovative person. By looking into the process of the transmission, I argue what kind of people become innovators and how the newly innovated technique is shared and spread among what kind of people. It is to argue how the new innovation is possible, and the followers copy the newly innovated technique.},

Findings on raw material exploitation have shown conclusively that Middle Paleolithic hominins, mainly Neanderthals, were extremely flexible, able to respond to a range of different constraints on the availability of stone and the organization of tasks on landscapes. Overall, studies of raw material economics show a remarkable level of consistency in modal and maximum distances of raw material transport and in the nature of and treatment of transported artifacts. This indicates that results are methodologically and empirically robust, and reveals important commonalities in hominin behavior. Research on raw material economy may also be limited a widespread focus on aggregate, assemblage-level observations. The next phase of methodological development should concentrate on the use of intra-assemblage variation as a means of investigating internally diversified prehistoric populations. A paradoxical feature of variation in artifact design and investment illustrate the importance of considering intra-group variation in behavior.},

  abstract = {Questions of morphological standardization in Paleolithic stone tools have important implications for the cognitive and technological capacities of early hominins. Past treatments of the topic suffer from an inadequate definition of the concept of ``standardization'' and a scarcity of quantitative comparisons of morphological variation. Ranges of variation in the sizes and shapes of Middle and Lower Paleolithic artifacts from several sites are compared using a bootstrapping method. These comparisons illustrate how variables related to the basic technological constraints of working isotropic stone and the fracture qualities of particular raw materials may lead to the appearance of differential standardization. Because they are influenced by so many factors, artifact forms may be less informative about technological ``design'' among ancient hominins than are phenomena such as core reduction and raw material exploitation.},

The two analytical methods are used to quantify changes in the rate of injury following the program, while taking into account the underlying annual and seasonal trends. Rates of severe injury during the period from 1983 to 1991 among children under the age of 17 years living in Central Harlem and in the neighboring community of Washington Heights are analyzed. The two methods provide similar point estimates of the effect of the intervention and have a good fit to the data. Although time series analysis has been promoted as the method of choice in analysis of sequential observations over long periods of time, this illustration suggests that Poisson regression is an attractive and viable alternative. Poisson regression provides a versatile analytical method for quantifying the time trends of relatively rare discrete outcomes, such as severe injuries, and provides a useful tool for epidemiologists involved with program evaluation.

Excavations recovered artifacts from radiocarbon dated deposits from both periods, and in light of the relatively brief occupational hiatus between occupations, it is important to assess the degree to which the spatial distribution and frequency of diagnostic tool forms were influenced by site formation processes. Our contextual analysis of site and sub-sample scale collections provide important insights into occupational history. The horizontal and vertical distribution of diagnostic tool forms illustrate that while some diagnostic tools, such as projectile points and hagdud truncations, co-occur in PPNA levels, others such as lunates are generally found in the stratigraphically deeper Late Natufian layers. Co-occurrence of some tool types is a by-product of mixing of cultural deposits, probably through the construction of semi-subterranean structures by PPNA people and by bioturbation. Est pr\'esent\'ee ici une analyse d\'etaill\'ee de l'industrie lithique des occupations du Natoufien final et du PPNA d" Iraq ed-Dubb, Jordanie. Les fouilles conduites sur ce gisement ont permis de recueillir des artefacts provenant de d\'ep\^ots dat\'es par le radiocarbone, les uns se situant avant, les autres apr\`es la transition chasseurs-cueilleurs/producteurs ; un hiatus a \'et\'e constat\'e dans l Occupation du site entre les deux. Aussi est-il apparu important d'estimer \`a quel point aussi bien la pr\'esence de certains outils diagnostiques que l'industrie dans son ensemble avaient pu \^etre affect\'ees \`a ' Iraq ed-Dubb par les processus deformations s\'edimentaires ayant fa\c{c}onn\'e le site ; par ailleurs dans quelle mesure des associations d'artefacts et certaines formes diagnostiques peuvent r\'eellement s'identifier \`a des d\'ep\^ots bien d\'efinis culturellement. Deux sujets sont trait\'es : d'une part, les r\'esultats apport\'es par la description des outils taill\'es d''Iraq ed-Dubb ; d'autre part, une \'etude approfondie de leurs contextes, l'id\'ee \'etant d'appr\'ecier dans quelle mesure ces derniers peuvent aider \`a comprendre l'histoire de l'occupation de ce site. Cette analyse des contextes a \'et\'e conduite \`a deux niveaux : l'un, \`a l'\'echelle du site ; l'autre, plus restreint a \'et\'e limit\'e \`a l'\'etude d'\'echantillons choisis sp\'ecifiquement. Cette recherche portant sur la distribution des outils diagnostiques fut conduite \`a la fois horizontalement - analyse spatiale \textemdash{} et verticalement - analyse stratigraphique -. Elle a montr\'e que des formes sp\'ecifiques - pointes de projectile, troncatures Hagdud-apparaissent ensemble dans les niveaux PPNA ; les segments de cercle, eux, sont attest\'es dans les niveaux stratigraphiquement les plus profonds (Natoufien final). Leur association r\'esulterait d'un m\'elange caus\'e par la construction de maisons semi-souterraines par les groupes humains PPNA et les perturbations qu ' elles ont pu engendrer. Cette contribution prend en compte la technologie de d\'ebitage, celle li\'ee au fa\c{c}onnage des outils, la variabilit\'e typologique des outils, les diff\'erences constat\'ees dans la r\'epartition des outils entre le Natoufien final et le PPNA, p\'eriodes qui sont critiques.},

  abstract = {The Danjiangkou Reservoir Region (DRR) in central China has been studied since 1994 and is known for its Large Cutting Tools (LCTs), with similarities to both western and south Asian LCTs of the Acheulean industrial complex. However, the origins of LCT technology in China is a much debated topic. In this paper, we address several of the major arguments used to support an indigenous development for eastern LCTsdgreater thickness, a poorer Refinement Index, greater weight, and a preference for cobbles over flakes for LCT blanks. In comparisons based on a large database of Acheulean LCTs, DRR examples are shown to compare well with Acheulean technology in terms of thickness and `refinement,' traits which we here link to raw material shapes and flaking properties. A relatively more frequent use of cobbles for blanks, however, characterizes the DRR and other Chinese LCTs, but there is also regional variability in this feature. Weight, on the other hand, is consistently larger for all Chinese LCTs, including those from DRR, although these fall at the low end of the range. Nevertheless, there are important features in common between Acheulean and Chinese LCTs which indicate either a common origin or periods of admixture culturally and probably physically. These features include the use of large flake blanks, the presence of cleavers in some industries, and the shaping of handaxes by both primary and secondary flaking. The influence of regional cultural traditions on Chinese material, geographic distance and limited migration routes, cultural drift, differences in subsistence ecology, and the demographics of small population sizes seem ultimately to be responsible for the differences, and they should not be used to obscure the commonalities.},

Chemical source studies of obsidian may provide the evidence necessary to document people's migrations between these regions. Sixty two obsidian artifacts from the late Pleistocene and Holocene Ushki Lake sites in Kamchatka Peninsula were analyzed by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA). Data generated demonstrate that multiple obsidian sources throughout Kamchatka were exploited by the inhabitants of Ushki Lake, and allow us to document long-distance population movements during the late Pleistocene and Holocene. It is reasonable to expect that obsidian from Kamchatka might have been transported to Alaska. This is true for the Chukotka region of Northeastern Siberia; obsidian from Chukotka has been found in late Holocene archaeological sites in Alaska. Ultimately, an expanded study that includes all areas of Northeast Asia and Alaska may provide the data necessary to document the earliest movements of people in these regions.},

We modeled the distribution of two forms of preEuropean contact intensive agriculture \textendash{} irrigated pondfields and rain-fed dryland systems \textendash{} across the Hawaiian archipelago using a GIS approach based on climate, hydrology, topography, substrate age, and soil fertility. Model results closely match the archaeological evidence in defined locations. On a broader scale, we calculate that the youngest island, Hawai'i, could have supported 572 km2 of intensive agriculture, 97\% as rain-fed dryland field systems, while Kaua'i, the oldest island, could have supported 58 km2, all as irrigated wetland systems. Irrigated systems have higher, more reliable yields and lower labor requirements than rain-fed dryland systems, so the total potential yield from Kaua'i (w49k metric tons) was almost half that of Hawai'i (w97k metric tons), although Kaua'i systems required only w0.05 of the agricultural labor (w8400 workers, versus w165,000 on Hawai'i) to produce the crops. We conclude that environmental constraints to intensive agriculture across the archipelago created asymmetric production efficiencies, and therefore varying potentials for agricultural surplus. The implications both for the emergence of complex sociopolitical formations and for anthropogenic transformation of Hawaiian ecosystems are substantial.},

It constitutes an exemplary case study: all our observations and measurements tend to prove the good integrity of the site and the anthropological nature of the artifacts and we are confident in the accuracy of the luminescence dating results. All these points underline the importance of the Toca da Tira Peia. The results bring new pieces of evidence of a human presence in the north-east of Brazil as early as 20,000 BC.

  abstract = {Niche construction is the process whereby organisms, through their activities and choices, modify their own and each other's niches. By transforming naturalselection pressures, niche construction generates feedback in evolution at various different levels. Niche-constructing species play important ecological roles by creating habitats and resources used by other species and thereby affecting the flow of energy and matter through ecosystems\textemdash a process often referred to as ``ecosystem engineering.'' An important emphasis of niche construction theory (NCT) is that acquired characters play an evolutionary role through transforming selective environments. This is particularly relevant to human evolution, where our species has engaged in extensive environmental modification through cultural practices. Humans can construct developmental environments that feed back to affect how individuals learn and develop and the diseases to which they are exposed. Here we provide an introduction to NCT and illustrate some of its more important implications for the human sciences.},

Nests of both species were built in relatively small standardized boxes erected in habitat patches that differed in the presence of the dominant oak species which was either summergreen deciduous or evergreen sclerophyllous. Nest size showed strong differences between species, and also in relation to environmental factors. Great tits built smaller nests than blue tits, Corsican birds had larger nests than mainland ones, nests tended to be larger in evergreen oak-habitat, and larger nests were built during drier weather. None of the individual-specific traits most often considered in long-term studies (lay-date, clutch size, and female age) were related to nest size in either species. Experimental approaches will be required to identify the underlying mechanisms that caused the observed phenotypic diversity for nest size in our study system.},

We describe the key features of these three levels and show how they are intimately connected. We hypothesize that, in the course of human social evolution, bands emerged as a level of social organization within existing communities. As predators, hunter-gatherers live at lower population densities than chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), even where the two species are sympatric. We propose that band formation evolved in humans from the more transient fissioning behavior seen within chimpanzee communities as a solution to the conflicting pressures of sustaining higher levels of cooperation required in hunting and the division of labor in a more dispersed community. If disputes break out, or if resources in the band territory are temporarily depleted, the existence of a wider community continues to be adaptive. To reconstruct the evolution of band society, we draw upon four lines of evidence: group (or network) size predicted from neocortex ratios, the distance materials were moved from their source during various periods in hominin evolution, ethnographic data on hunter-gatherer daily foraging ranges and population densities collated by the authors, and fossil hominin morphology. From these data, we conclude that key features of modern human hunter-gatherer social organization probably appear in the course of the evolution of Homo heidelbergensis.},

This process eventually pointed most strongly to McDonald Island in the Antarctic region southwest of Australia. This was confirmed only after unpublished geochemical data for the island were found.

  abstract = {The site of Canteen Kopje in Barkly West, South Africa, has provided the archaeological
record with an invaluable collection of Earlier Stone Age artefacts. An alluvial deposit
approximately 1km from the modern Vaal River, the site contains an abundance of artefacts.
A 2007 \textendash{} 2009 excavation in Pit 6 has provided an assemblage of over 15,000 artefacts that
has been dated by cosmogenic nuclide burial method. Three distinct assemblages show
technological changes through time of the earlier Acheulean industrial complex. The
youngest industry, the Prepared Core Technology Assemblage, is dated to 1.2 {$\pm$} .07 Ma and
contains Victoria West prepared core technology. Beneath it is the Organised Core
Assemblage which is void of Victoria West prepared core technology but contains cores that
demonstrate more organised knapping techniques in the form of asymmetrical control. This
assemblage is dated to 1.51 {$\pm$}0.8 Ma. Finally, the underlying Basal Early Acheulean
Assembage lacks both prepared cores and organised cores and is {$>$}1.51 Ma in age. The
abundance of large angular clasts of andesite in the area made multiple knapping strategies
effective for the manufacture of large flakes. A technological sequence in the knapping
strategies has emerged in this excavation, from simple cores to organised cores and finally
prepared cores. The older technologies clearly display the roots of prepared core technology
in the asymmetrical control of the organised knapping methods. The overall success of the
knapping strategies prior to the appearance of the Victoria West industry in the Canteen
Kopje archaeological record creates questions as to why more complex strategies might have
been implemented over time. Analysis of the assemblages from the Pit 6 excavation fails to
provide a clear technological explanation within the empirical data as to why this change
occurs. This research therefore argues that the Victoria West prepared core knapping strategy
is a localized stone age culturally motivated knapping tradition},

  abstract = {Material evidence from the Korean early Late Paleolithic, dating between the end of MIS 3 and the beginning of MIS 2, shows that Paleolithic tools were primarily comprised of simply made cores and flakes and a small number of blades. The blade toolkits were introduced, but did not immediately replace coexisting simplified forms of tools. Simple core and flake tool assemblages (SCFA) were dominant, and were maintained without any positive cultural or technological modifications during this period of time. Revolutionary appearances of behavioral modernity did not occur during the early stage of the Late Paleolithic period. Efficient behavioral innovations rapidly extending across the peninsula occurred only after that period of time. The blades seem not to be regarded truly as a technological marker which normally replaced preexisting simple stone tools; the advantages of SCFA, which comprise of agile and expedient toolkits, played a key role. This implies that the Korean Mode 4 assemblage during the early stage of the Late Paleolithic does not truly represent a technocomplex breakthrough. The puzzling lack of more standardized tools should be viewed not as a conventional cultural tradition. More diverse transmitted elements for interpreting the preferences for expedient tools among forager groups may be required.},

Here, I review this literature and suggest that many of its findings are relevant to hominin intelligence. In particular, our large brains and increased intelligence may be partly independent of our ape phylogeny and the result of convergent processes similar to those that have molded avian and platyrrhine intelligence. Tool use, innovativeness and cultural transmission might be linked over our past and in our brains as operations of domain-general intelligence. Finally, colonization of new areas may have accompanied increases in both brain size and innovativeness in hominins as they have in other mammals and in birds, potentially accelerating hominin evolution via behavioral drive.},

Evidence for culture in nonhuman species continues to grow, but there are few candidate examples of cumulative culture outside humans' distinctively complex achievements. Human culture is uniquely variable in nature, as exemplified by the extraordinary diversity across technological skills and social practices within and among populations. Human psychological flexibility provides the foundation for cultural diversity and is a prerequisite for cumulative culture. It allows humans to build upon established behaviors by relinquishing old solutions and flexibly switching to more productive or efficient ones (128).},

  abstract = {Human culture is unique among animals in its complexity, variability, and cumulative quality. This article describes the development and diversity of cumulative cultural learning. Children inhabit cultural ecologies that consist of group-specific knowledge, practices, and technologies that are inherited and modified over generations. The learning processes that enable cultural acquisition and transmission are universal but are sufficiently flexible to accommodate the highly diverse cultural repertoires of human populations. Children learn culture in several complementary ways, including through exploration, observation, participation, imitation, and instruction. These methods of learning vary in frequency and kind within and between populations due to variation in socialization values and practices associated with specific educational institutions, skill sets, and knowledge systems. The processes by which children acquire and transmit the cumulative culture of their communities provide unique insight into the evolution and ontogeny of human cognition and culture.},

This paper will review how the spatial structure of biological populations and communities can be studied. We first demonstrate that many of the basic statistical methods used in ecological studies are impaired by autocorrelated data. Most if not all environmental data fall in this category. We will look briefly at ways of performing valid statistical tests in the presence of spatial autocorrelation. Methods now available for analysing the spatial structure of biological populations are described, and illustrated by vegetation data. These include various methods to test for the presence of spatial autocorrelation in the data: univariate methods (all-directional and two-dimensional spatial correlograms, and twodimensional spectral analysis), and the multivariate Mantel test and Mantel correlogram; other descriptive methods of spatial structure: the univariate variogram, and the multivariate methods of clustering with spatial contiguity constraint; the partial Mantel test, presented here as a way of studying causal models that include space as an explanatory variable; and finally, various methods for mapping ecological variables and producing either univariate maps (interpolation, trend surface analysis, kriging) or maps of truly multivariate data (produced by constrained clustering). A table shows the methods classified in terms of the ecological questions they allow to resolve. Reference is made to available computer programs.},

Despite the importance of brain size increase, the developmental bases of human brain size evolution remain poorly characterized. Comparative analyses of endocranial volume size growth illustrate that distinctions between humans and other primates are consequences of differences in rates of brain size growth, with little evidence for differences in growth duration. Evaluation of available juvenile fossils shows that earliest hominins do not differ perceptibly from chimpanzees (Pan). However, rapid and human-like early brain growth apparently characterized Homo erectus at about 1 Ma before present. Neandertals show patterns of brain growth consistent with modern humans during infancy, but reach larger sizes than modern humans as a result of differences in later growth. Growth analyses reveal commonalities in patterns of early brain size growth during the last million years human evolution, despite major increases in adult size. This result implies consistency across hominins in terms of maternal metabolic costs of infancy. Continued size growth past infancy in Neandertals and modern humans, when compared to earlier hominins, may have cognitive implications. Differences between Neandertals and modern humans are implied, but difficult to define with certainty.},

  abstract = {Farming and herding were introduced to Europe from the Near East and Anatolia; there are, however, considerable arguments about the mechanisms of this transition. Were it the people who moved and either outplaced or admixed with the indigenous hunter-gatherer groups? Or was it material and information that moveddthe Neolithic Packagedconsisting of domesticated plants and animals and the knowledge of their use? The latter process is commonly referred to as cultural diffusion and the former as demic diffusion. Despite continuous and partly combined efforts by archaeologists, anthropologists, linguists, palaeontologists and geneticists, a final resolution of the debate has not yet been reached. In the present contribution we interpret results from the Global Land Use and technological Evolution Simulator (GLUES). This mathematical model simulates regional sociocultural development embedded in the geoenvironmental context during the Holocene. We demonstrate that the model is able to realistically hindcast the expansion speed and the inhomogeneous space-time evolution of the transition to agropastoralism in western Eurasia. In contrast to models that do not resolve endogenous sociocultural dynamics, our model describes and explains how and why the Neolithic advanced in stages. We uncouple the mechanisms of migration and information exchange and also of migration and the spread of agropastoralism. We find that (1) an indigenous form of agropastoralism could well have arisen in certain Mediterranean landscapes but not in northern and central Europe, where it depended on imported technology and material; (2) both demic diffusion by migration and cultural diffusion by trade may explain the western European transition equally well; (3) migrating farmers apparently contribute less than local adopters to the establishment of agropastoralism. Our study thus underlines the importance of adoption of introduced technologies and economies by resident foragers.},

  abstract = {The Late Pleistocene is a key period to understand the shift from the Middle (MSA) to the Late Stone Age (LSA) in Africa. More generally, it is also a crucial time for elucidation of changes in the technological behaviours of human populations in Africa after the main Out of Africa event of modern humans ca. 60-50 thousand years ago. However, the archaeological record for this period is relatively poor, particularly for the Horn of Africa. Here we present a detailed analysis of the lithic assemblages from Goda Buticha (GB), a cave in southeastern Ethiopia, which has yielded a long stratigraphic sequence including Late Pleistocene and Holocene levels. This study (1) contributes to a better knowledge of the late MSA in the Horn of Africa; (2) documents a late Holocene LSA level (GB \textendash{} Complex I); (3) highlights the presence of MSA characteristics associated with LSA features in the Holocene (GB \textendash{} Layer IIc). This adds to the emerging record of great lithic technological variability during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene in this region.Le Pl\'eistoc\`ene r\'ecent est une p\'eriode cl\'e pour comprendre le changement du Middle (MSA) vers le Late Stone Age (LSA) en Afrique.

Silicon nitride is a brittle material and partial cone cracks, or c-cracks, originate from contact interactions during manufacturing. These cracks limit the Rolling Contact Fatigue (RCF) life of the balls. Here the authors examine subsurface Hertzian stresses between contacting spheres, using an analytical stress solution, to investigate their applicability to predicting and characterizing crack size and shape. The authors also incrementally develop these cracks through an iterative crack growth procedure using a 3D finite element analysis. Comparisons are then made to experimental images of the flaws in silicon nitride. By varying the initial conditions during the contact interaction of the balls we demonstrate that a wide range of cone and partial cone cracks, observed in practice, can be generated using both the analytical and numerical fracture mechanics approaches. Furthermore, an expression is presented for the impact velocity that induces a cone crack from a maximum radial stress criterion at the contact periphery.},

  abstract = {An examination of musical participation and taboo among the egalitarian Mbendjele BaYaka illustrates how cultural learning can be organized without recourse to figures of authority. The chapter describes two complementary pedagogic processes that accompany BaYaka as they move through life. One acts on groups of people playing together (massana), the other on individuals as they are differently affected by taboos (ekila). Both serve to lead growing BaYaka into opportunities for learning more abstract cultural knowledge at salient points in the life cycle.In successfully performing the dense polyphony of BaYaka music (massana), people experience what BaYaka consider to be desirable emotions, ideal relationships, and interaction. They participate in an enhanced learning environment that promotes peer-to-peer imitation rather than direct instruction with its concomitant implication of authority and status. Key economic strategies and political orientations are experienced during massana in ways that stimulate their application to non-massana contexts. The ethnography of ekila demonstrates how counterintuitive explanations of striking hunting and reproductive prohibitions stimulate a learner-motivated pedagogic process that does not depend on defining any individual as a focus for learning important knowledge. These taboos anchor key areas of cosmological knowledge, gender, and political ideology in the physical and biological experiences of human growth and maturation making gendered practices and cultural values take on a natural, inevitable quality.Together, massana and ekila provide major avenues for BaYaka children to learn and to reproduce a distinctive and remarkably durable cultural system. The chapter finishes by suggesting some structural features of these culturally embedded pedagogic systems that contribute to their efficacy, durability and ability to adapt to, and incorporate change.},

  abstract = {I explore the use of multiple regression on distance matrices (MRM), an extension of partial Mantel analysis, in spatial analysis of ecological data. MRM involves a multiple regression of a response matrix on any number of explanatory matrices, where each matrix contains distances or similarities (in terms of ecological, spatial, or other attributes) between all pair-wise combinations of n objects (sample units); tests of statistical significance are performed by permutation. The method is flexible in terms of the types of data that may be analyzed (counts, presence \textendash absence, continuous, categorical) and the shapes of response curves. MRM offers several advantages over traditional partial Mantel analysis: (1) separating environ-mental distances into distinct distance matrices allows inferences to be made at the level of individual variables; (2) nonparametric or nonlinear multiple regression methods may be employed; and (3) spatial autocorrelation may be quantified and tested at different spatial scales using a series of lag matrices, each representing a geographic distance class. The MRM lag matrices model may be parameterized to yield very similar inferences regarding spatial autocorrelation as the Mantel correlogram. Unlike the correlogram, however, the lag matrices model may also include environmental distance matrices, so that spatial patterns in species abundance distances (community similarity) may be quantified while controlling for the envi-ronmental similarity between sites. Examples of spatial analyses with MRM are presented.},

Neither Neanderthal fossils nor typical Mousterian assemblages have been reported in East Asia to date.

The lithic industry at Jinsitai appeared at least 47e42 ka and persisted until around 40e37 ka. These findings expand the geographic range of the Mousterian-like industries at least 2000 km further to the east than what has been previously recognized. This discovery supplies a missing part of the picture of Middle Paleolithic distribution in Eurasia and also demonstrates the makers' capacity to adapt to diverse geographic regions and habitats of Eurasia.},

Temporal differences in the morphology of handaxes between the two assemblages are not shown in most metrical attributes and indices used in this study. In contrast, extensive variability is observed at the intra-assemblage level in both samples, with Cave of Hearths showing relatively more variability.

  abstract = {Stone tools played an important role in the everyday life of the ancient Maya. Whether for ritual or domestic uses, stone tools were required to complete everyday tasks. Access to stone resources used to make tools, including chert, likely influenced the sociopolitical relationships between communities and cities across the ancient landscape. Through various methods including field survey, lab analysis, and statistical analysis, various chert resources in Northwestern Belize are identified and analyzed in order to recognize chert procurement locations and possible tool production sites or workshops. In addition, an overall analysis of chert quality is included to form a better understanding of how chert may have moved across the landscape. These chert materials are then compared to the bifacial chert tools from the site of Xnoha. A medium sized Maya city, Xnoha, appears to have been a consumer of these nearby chert resources and provided a large sample of bifaces dating to the Late Preclassic through the Classic periods. While this research is just a beginning for chert sourcing in Northwestern Belize, it identifies important resource locations across the landscape, provides information on the quality and makeup of the stone in this region, and points this topic towards methods of analysis that may increase our knowledge in the future.},

This paper explores the analogical nature of archaeological inference and the relationship between experimental design and inference validity in stone artifact experimentation. We show that actualistic flintknapping lacks vital aspects of scientific experimentation, and thus has inherent inferential issues of analogical adequacy and confidence. It is argued that a greater emphasis on hypothesis construction and variable control is needed in order to establish sound referential linkages upon which constructive analogic inferences about the past can be built.},

However, noticeably less attention has been paid to the ontological nature of stone artifacts and the adequateness of the inferential reasoning for drawing archaeological interpretations from these artifacts. This dissertation takes a scientific perspective to rethink critically the ways that current lithic approaches generate knowledge about past hominin behavior from stone artifacts through experimentation (Chapter 2), and further, to explore the use of controlled experiments and uniformitarian principles for deriving inferences. The latter is presented as two case studies about Late Pleistocene Neanderthal behavior in southwestern France (Chapter 3 \& 4).},

However, these dates are scattered among numerous sources (many difficult to obtain) and are presented in a number of different formats and calibrations. The goal of this paper is to compile a usable, systematic database of all of these Palauan cultural 14C assays. This database will be suitable for developing and evaluating chronological models, an effort being undertaken as a separate paper. Prior to constructing prehistoric colonization and cultural chronologies for Palau, the validity of each assay and the relative adequacy in sample size per cultural and environmental zones must be examined. After systematic recalibration, the reliability of the dates is evaluated in light of sample material, cultural context, and site formation processes. A method for dating monumental earthwork complexes through site formation analysis is presented. Sets of 237 valid and 58 potentially valid 14C dates remain to develop chronological models. The representation of Palau's environmental zones, site types, and regions within the dating pool is examined and compared to ensure meaningfulness in these chronological models. Newly obtained 14C age determinations are also provided.},

Average ?18O and ?13C values from rhizoliths formed in transgressive lacustrine (waxy) claystones are relatively low. Low ?18O averages (؊5.5\textperthousand ) reflect meteoric water values consistent with increased precipitation during wet periods that would increase the outflow of fresh water from subsurface seeps and shift a brackish groundwater zone lakeward. Low ?13C averages (؊4.1\textperthousand ) could indicate little atmospheric exchange, high plant decay, and/or increased groundwater (low ?13C) flow. Higher averages in ?18O (؊3.6\textperthousand ) and ?13C (؊2.0\textperthousand ) occur during dry periods and lake regressions (earthy claystones), when hydraulic head is reduced, the lake recedes, and water within the wetlands is subjected to intense evaporation and gas exchange with the atmosphere. The isotope ratios of the rhizoliths from lowermost Bed II change in response to groundwater hydrology on Milankovitch time scales, but the isotopes also provide evidence of shorter-term (decadal to centennial scale) climate fluctuations. The orbitally driven climate changes are recorded faithfully by lithologic variations and stable isotope patterns.},

Consumption of a variety of exotics appeared to be widespread since the very first stages of London's establishment and their presence was maintained throughout although later on, as life in the town developed and its character changed, the focus of their distribution also changed. The emphasis shifted from the core of the city in its early days towards its outer zones, such as the upper Walbrook valley and Southwark in the Middle Roman, and the western and eastern sectors in the Late Roman phase. These changes appeared to largely reflect the changes in the overall commerce network of exotics in Britannia. In this network London starts as a mainly consumption place in the Early Roman phase to become the main redistribution centre in the Middle Roman and the necessary intermediate node in the transport system that had been established by the Late Roman phase, connecting the south to the north.},

Victoria West cores bear similarities to the `Volumetric Concept'

differences also occur that make the Victoria West a unique
and distinctive prepared core technology; these are: elongated
and convergent core shapes, consistent blow directions for flake
removal, a predominance of large side-struck flakes, and the
use of these flakes to make Acheulean large cutting tools. This
innovative core reduction strategy at Canteen Kopje extends the roots of prepared core technology to the latter part of the Early Acheulean and clearly
demonstrates an increase in the cognitive abilities and complexities of hominids in this time period.},

The lithic industries indicate mastery of all production systems for flakes, blades, points and to a lesser extent, bifaces. During the Upper Pleistocene, occupation of this territory by Neandertal groups is important. The vast majority of these lithic series cannot be attributed to cultural facies of Mousterian defined by Bordes, due to the low number of retouched tools. Aside from some typical Mousterian of Acheulean tradition bifaces and blade production characteristic of the Early Weichselian, which are stylistic and cultural markers, there is nothing to differentiate Mousterian groups. In an attempt to identify their cultural identities, lithic assemblages were apprehended globally, using the operative sequence concept from the acquisition of raw material to the final objectives of the different production systems, and abandonment of tools. The situation is considered from each chronostratigraphic phase to try to distinguish the settlement patterns of this region. This renewed approach to technical studies points to a wide diversity of Neandertal adaptive faculties, which can be interpreted in terms of cultural diversity.},

Based on recent evidence for the use of bow-and-arrow technology during the Middle Stone Age in southern Africa by 64 kya, we use the method of generating and analysing cognigrams and effective chains to explore thought-and-action sequences associated with this technology. We show that, when isolated, neither the production of a simple bow, nor that of a stone-tipped arrow, can be reasonably interpreted to indicate tool behaviour that is cognitively more complex than the composite artefacts produced by Neanderthals or archaic modern
              Homo
              . On the other hand, as soon as a bow-and-arrow set is used as an effective group of tools, a novel cognitive development is expressed in technological symbiosis, i.e. the ability to conceptualize a set of separate, yet inter-dependent tools. Such complementary tool sets are able to unleash new properties of a tool, inconceivable without the active, simultaneous manipulation of another tool. Consequently, flexibility regarding decision-making and taking action is amplified. The archaeological evidence for such amplified conceptual and technological modularization implies a range of cognitive and behavioural complexity and flexibility that is basic to human behaviour today.},

The Talaud Islands have a rich and significant archaeological record going back to the Pleistocene and are instrumental in understanding Pleistocene colonisation of small islands and later models of Austronesian language dispersal. Here we report on vertebrate material excavated from Leang Mande'et, a late Holocene rockshelter on Karakelang, the main island in the Talaud group. The site represents a periodically occupied shelter used for gardening. Fauna recovered predominately comprises murid elements, with at least four taxa (Rattus rattus, Rattus exulans and two Melomys species) found. The rodents show clear signs of being deposited by raptors rather than humans, unlike the small number of fish remains also recovered. DNA sequences from several Rattus rattus specimens are referrable to Rattus rattus complex lineage IV, a lineage with a southern Indochinese origins and broad modern representation through Indonesia and the Philippines. The lack of any Rattus rattus complex lineage II from Leang Mande'et suggests that the first agricultural inhabitants of this island did not come from Taiwan or northern Indochina, but rather that they either originated from the south or that, once established in the Talauds, opened up significant trade networks to the south and in the process acquired a significant pest.},

  abstract = {In principle, new theoretical structures in physics, unlike arches and other architectural structures, could be erected without the use of any scaffolds. After all, that is essentially how the four-dimensional formalism of special relativity, the curved space-times of general relativity, and the Hilbert-space formalism of quantum mechanics are introduced in modern textbooks. Historically, however, such structures, like arches, were originally erected on top of elaborate scaffolds provided by the structures they eventually either partially or completely replaced. The metaphor of arches and scaffolds highlights the remarkable degree of continuity in instances of theory change that, at first sight, look strikingly discontinuous. After putting to rest some historiographical scruples about the metaphor and presupposing as little knowledge of the relevant physics and mathematics as possible, I describe how some key steps in the development of relativity and quantum theory in the early decades of the 20th century are captured quite naturally in terms of arches and scaffolds. Given how easy it is to find examples of this kind, I argue that it may be worthwhile to further analyze this pattern of theory change with the help of some of Stephen Jay Gould's ideas about evolutionary biology, especially his notion of constraints.},

Here, we present the dating of the Kathu Pan 6 sequence using multiple luminescence signals: optically stimulated luminescence (blue OSL) and thermally transferred OSL (TT-OSL) on quartz; and the infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) post IR-IR290 signal on potassium feldspar. The results obtained from analyses of different minerals and signals for the archaeological deposits do not always conform but the quartz OSL provides the most accurate set of ages for the HP at KP6 (between 100 {$\pm$} 6 and 74 {$\pm$} 5 ka). This age range places the KP6 HP earlier than any of the scenarios considered plausible by Jacobs and Roberts (Journal of Human Evolution, 107, 1\textendash 13 2017) but fits well with the extended duration for the HP at Diepkloof proposed by Tribolo et al. (Journal of Archaeological Science, 36(3) 730\textendash 39 2009) and promoted by Feathers (Journal of Archaeological Science, 63, 164\textendash 174 2017). Two OSL ages bracket the Later Stone Age Wilton industry at KP6, placing it between 5.7 {$\pm$} 0.3 ka and 2.3 {$\pm$} 0.1 ka. These fit with known ages for the Wilton and place the KP6 occupation contemporary with Strata 4c\textendash 3b at Wonderwerk Cave.},

These levels also contain an archaic lithic industry consisting of pebble tools, cores and flakes, and large mammal remains attributed to the beginning of the Lower Pleistocene (Biharian). The basalt flow has been previously dated to about 1.85~Ma, but the overlying volcanic ash level had not yet been dated. In this paper, we present 40Ar/39Ar dating of plagioclase and glass from the volcanic ash level that has yielded Quaternary fauna, lithic artefacts and several human remains, which gives an age of 1.81{$\pm$}0.05~Ma. The subcontemporaneity of Hominid presence and volcanic ash deposition makes Dmanisi the oldest prehistoric site currently known in Europe and proves human presence at the gates of Europe 1.81~Ma ago.

Although these models build on conventional ideas about utility firmly embedded in zooarchaeological analyses, when cast in an evolutionary framework these ideas produce some of the most sophisticated and elegant interpretations of archaeofaunas to date. In this article I review the methodological and practical strengths and weaknesses of current zooarchaeological applications of foraging models. Recent applications of foraging models to the zooarchaeological record reveal important variability in human-prey interactions across time and space. Case-specific applications generate theoretical and methodological advances that augment and are complementary to model building in allied fields. Recent applications also identify shortcomings in the underlying assumptions and rationale of some foraging models that mirror past and on-going discussions in anthropology and biology. I discuss how these shortcomings can fruitfully direct future applications and research in foraging economics.},

  abstract = {Cores from South Africa assigned to the ``Victoria West'' industry have long been purported as a ``protoLevallois'' core form, and thus regarded as ancestral to the Levallois prepared core technologies of the Middle Paleolithic and African Middle Stone Age. Similarities in form between Victoria West cores, in terms of surface morphology and the removal of large flakes from a prepared surface, led to hypothesized schemes of technological evolution from Victoria West cores through to fully developed Levallois cores. However, the phylogenetic basis of this Victoria West ``proto-Levallois'' hypothesis, and the assumptions of phylogenetic homology upon which it rests, have never been tested formally. In recent years, archaeologists have begun to use phylogenetic methods drawn from biology to test hypotheses of technological and cultural evolution. Here, the phylogenetic assumptions of the Victoria West ``protoLevallois'' hypothesis are tested directly using a cladistic (maximum parsimony) protocol. The cladistic analyses indicate that Victoria West cores are not the basal sister taxon of a Levallois clade, as predicted by the proto-Levallois hypothesis. Moreover, character analyses demonstrate that several characters relating to core surfaces and flake scar morphology are not phylogenetically homologous, but result from convergent technological evolution within the Acheulean techno-complex. Post hoc analyses further determine that these results are not confounded by choice of outgroup or raw material factors. The results were also shown to be robust on the basis of the ensemble retention index statistic, bootstrap analyses, and permutation tests. Hence, it is concluded that Victoria West cores do not represent a ``proto-Levallois'' core form, and that the term ``para-Levallois'' should more correctly be applied on phylogenetic grounds. It is further argued that even in cases where different technologies are found to share phylogenetically homologous features, use of the term ``proto'' is questionable on theoretical grounds.},

Somewhat analogous to flintknapping, the successful performance of conjuring tricks also relies on effective deployment of physical actions and techniques to bring about desired outcomes. To prevent spectators detecting the cause\textendash effect relationships between these physical actions, conjurors use various forms of ``misdirection.'' Recently, there has been intensified academic interest in misdirection by experimental psychologists and cognitive scientists. Here, we show that misdirection provides a valuable model for examining the cognitively challenging elements of learning to knap through observation. Several implications arise from conceiving of these issues in terms of their capacity for ``misdirection.'' This includes the possibility of connecting them with well-understood psychological mechanisms, especially those underpinning the cognition of accurate perception, attention, memory, and reasoning. This can open novel avenues of enquiry relating to social learning, the evolution of technological ``complexity,'' and for connecting archaeology with cognitive neuroscience.},

The term ``evolution'' and its traditionally biological connotations, however, can provide a source of confusion, which might cause hindrance to those trying to understand the growing array of case studies that utilize these methods. Given this, a brief review of the current theoretical basis for cultural evolutionary approaches is given, which largely draws on social transmission theory. Thereafter, recent advances in the field are discussed, which have involved both methodological developments and a flourishing of empirical examples of application. Finally, future directions are considered, which, as in any developing field, will probably involve further development of both its theoretical and empirical basis, and the interaction of the two. As David Clarke identified almost half a century ago, the great strength of the archaeological record is its power to reveal meaningful patterns of artifactual variation over temporal and spatial scales, especially in statistical terms.

  abstract = {The ``Acheulean'' is comprised of individual knapping events undertaken by individual hominins. In other words, it is a particular component of hominin behavior that we draw out and amalgamate into a wider ``pattern.'' The resultant phenomenon (i.e., ``the Acheulean'') is an entity that stretches over the space of three continents and spans a time period in excess of one million years. If such an exercise has any merit, it is because it provides a means of comparative (behavioral) analysis over these swathes of time and space. Comparative research can document, measure, and statistically assess temporo-spatial patterns of artifactual variation, and so test hypotheses regarding the character of that variation. However, it does not provide an independent means of examining some of the key phenomena which it is necessary to further understand in order to increase our comprehension of this archaeological legacy. Here, we review and synthesize recent experimental work that we have undertaken, which has specifically investigated some of the factors potentially responsible for the generation and constraint of variation within the Acheulean techno-complex. We examine issues of raw material, copying errors, and their relationship to mechanisms of social learning. Understanding these microevolutionary factors via experiments, we contend, is essential in order to reach a secure understanding of the macroscale phenomenon typically referred to as the ``Acheulean.'' Moreover, we outline how a ``quantitative genetic'' framework to these issues provides an essential means of linking these inherent micro- and macro-evolutionary factors into a coherent whole, while also simultaneously reconciling the potential influence of different sources of variation that are part of a temporally and geographically dispersed entity such as the Acheulean.},

  abstract = {Contemporary scientific archaeology has an array of methodological approaches at its disposal. In addition to a multitude of specialist techniques, this endeavour may, more generally, draw upon data from field survey and excavation, experimental approaches and mathematical modelling. However, the extent to which these different strands of enquiry are adopted may vary widely from researcher to researcher. Lip service is often paid to the notion of `integrating' different approaches but whether this is genuinely achieved is debatable, while some may ignore one or more particular approach entirely. The study of Levallois artefacts (e.g. flakes and cores) has been an important topic within Palaeolithic archaeology for more than a century. Studies of these artefacts have been implicated in major debates concerning cognitive and behavioural aspects of evolution in hominins. Here, we discuss something of the history of investigation into Levallois, and consider whether insights that have been gained by applying data from artefactual studies, experiment and mathematical modelling might point toward ways in which such alternative approaches might be integrated more closely. Key to this, we argue, is exploitation of the concepts of `internal validity' versus `external validity', which are possessed by these contrasting data sources to varying degrees. By emphasizing both the strengths, but also the weaknesses of these different avenues of enquiry, these validity concepts may enable a better sense of how the links between them can be strengthened in archaeological enquiry.},

  abstract = {Levallois reduction was geographically widespread during the Middle Palaeolithic, being practiced by both Neanderthals (Homo neanderthalensis) and early Modern Humans (Homo sapiens). Here, we review and synthesize a range of recent work that we have undertaken on the issue of Levallois, with the aim of further considering its implications in terms of social learning during the Palaeolithic. Specifically, our recent experimental work has provided evidence that Levallois reduction supplied flakes that have predictable benefits from a functional perspective, and also supported an hypothesis that it has benefits relating to raw material economy. Geometric morphometric analyses of archaeological cores have, meanwhile, demonstrated that examples conforming to ``classic'' (lineal) Levallois form have certain geometric properties that display limited variation, even across wide geographic regions. Hence, replicating this morphology consistently may have demanded specific requirements on the part of individual knappers in order to procure its potential benefits. Given these findings, it may be important to ask whether replication of ``Levallois'' industries involved social transmission mechanisms beyond those used by populations producing earlier forms of stone tools. Drawing on findings from the literature on social learning, we outline a series of factors that suggest this to be the case. Although independent tests of this hypothesis are required, within the context of Lower-Middle Palaeolithic industries, Levallois reduction stands out as a candidate potentially requiring active instruction (i.e., teaching) for effective cultural replication.},

  abstract = {Lithic artifacts are increasingly being used to address questions in evolutionary, i.e., historical, terms. The explicit assumption in such analyses is that lithic attributes reflect patterns of inheritance via social learning. However, both raw material and reduction factors are known to be potential sources of lithic variation. The cultural\textendash evolutionary analysis of lithic variability must, therefore, reconcile heritable and nonheritable sources of variation under a single coherent framework. Moreover, there is a frequent assumption that conveniently measureable features, such as the relative shape of a biface at a specific point of its length, can be used as indicators of heritable variation. The use of such traits, however, is potentially questionable, especially in the light of controlled experiments that indicate that traits such as platform depths and angles influence the form of individual flakes. As such, it may be reasonable to consider whether such features represent more appropriate analytical units. Here, we contend that the solution to these problems lies in application of a ``quantitative genetics'' approach, which was designed to solve directly analogous problems in biology. This approach explicitly models multiple sources of variation simultaneously. Moreover, it provides a logical rationale for how evolutionary forces (e.g., drift and selection) can operate when only part of this variation is potentially heritable. We outline specifically how quantitative genetic theory can be rewritten for use with lithic artifacts. Thereafter, we provide example analyses of data, which support our case. We conclude by summarizing the merits of this framework and outline future extensions.},

The combined finite-discrete element method (FEM/DEM) is a state-of-the-art numerical modelling technique pioneered in the mid-1990s. Y2D is a robust two-dimensional FEM/DEM research code developed by Munjiza in 2004. The major limitations of this code are (1) the lack of a graphical user interface (GUI) meaning that all pre-processing has to be made directly on an ASCII input file and (2) the inability of dealing with heterogeneous media. This contribution presents the first GUI and preprocessor, known as Y-GUI, developed for Y2D and the implementation of a new algorithm that allows for the use of heterogeneous materials. In the text all major FEM/DEM concepts are described, together with the main features available in the Y-GUI. The use of Y-GUI is presented in detail and some of its functionalities, including the heterogeneity module to be used to randomly assign materials to a mesh, are introduced. At the end of the manuscript, four case studies, including Brazilian tests of a homogeneous and a layered rock sample and a rock avalanche, are presented.},

  abstract = {The late Lower Palaeolithic was a turbulent period with many changes in subsistence as well variations in the material culture. Yet, despite its importance, few detailed descriptions have been published. In this article we present a techno-typological report on the variability and continuity along the depositional sequence of Area C East, at the open-air site of Revadim, Israel. In order to learn how and in what ways smaller scale variations over time, as well as of micro- environmental changes, affect lithic assemblages the lithic assemblage was initially analysed through the raw material acquisition followed by the examination of flaking methods, analysing the geometrical organisation of the core's volume, recording debitage characteristics and the affinities of the retouched artefacts. The artefacts were documented using 3-D technology and novel methods for analysing the digital image. The technological analysis of the lithic assemblages revealed the existence of four main reduction sequences. The typological variations representing tactical, short term functional need, while the flaking methods are structured learned behaviours socially mediated exhibited via raw material exploitation. The lithic assemblage is a package of both technological and typological traits that remains stable through a prolonged (as yet unknown) period of time. The range of variations of lithic technology of Revadim (ie, the number of technological options and their relative frequency) is maintained throughout micro-environmental changes. The structure of variation observed in Revadim \textendash{} within a smaller scale, has also been noticed in other Late Lower Palaeolithic assemblages, this in sharp contrast to previous studies of the Lower Palaeolithic and later Early Middle Palaeolithic.},

Those decision-making processes are dependent upon the mode of occupation and land-use patterns. These issues are widely discussed in both ethnographic and Paleolithic literature; however, it has rarely been demonstrated technologically in Lower Paleolithic contexts. In this paper, using the case study of the Late Lower Paleolithic site of Holon in Israel, I address questions regarding the selection of particular curational strategies differently employed for various parts of the assemblage. Tool maintenance and the byproducts of such strategies will be described and articulated within the organization of technology at Holon. In addition, I will examine the micro-environmental setting in which these curational behaviors exist. In Holon, the complexity of the curational organization can be regarded as a chosen tactic, rather than an obligatory response to a deficiency in raw material. Thus, the results of this study exemplify how possible functional needs modify the known techotypological repertoire. The nature of this interplay has rarely been described within Middle Pleistocene contexts.},

  abstract = {The terms Lower Palaeolithic and Middle Palaeolithic represent research constructs within which cultural evolution and prehistoric hominin behaviours can be studied, with the transition usually understood as marking a watershed in our evolution: an adaptation with a million-year record of success that gives way to something new. The interpretation of the Lower Palaeolithic Acheulian technocomplex is usually understood as a period of cultural stasis that extends over much of Africa and Eurasia, principally associated with Homo erectus. Those innovations that can be observed occur widely separated from one another in space and time. Yet a closer and more detailed examination of the Middle Pleistocene records from East Africa, southern Africa, Europe and the Levant reveals significant variation in cultural repertoires. A kind of paradox emerges, in which an Old World Lower Palaeolithic, apparently lacking an overall dynamic of distinctive and directed change in terms of cumulative variation over time, nevertheless culminates in a transition which sees the universal appearance of the Middle Palaeolithic. The two main hypotheses that have been advanced to explain the global transition, which happens essentially synchronously, appear mutually exclusive and contradictory. One view is that altered climatic-environmental constraints enabled and encouraged an `Out-of-Africa' dispersal (or dispersals) of a new type of genus Homo. This cultural replacement model has been challenged more recently by the alternative hypothesis of accumulating but unrelated and temporally non-linked regional, and in fact potentially autochthonous, processes. The Levant, by virtue of its position bridging Africa and Eurasia (thus being the region into which any out-of-Africa groups would have had first to disperse into), must be seen as a critical region for assessing the relative merits of these competing hypotheses. This paper deals with the Lower\textendash Middle Paleolithic boundary in the Levant within a long temporal perspective. The Middle Pleistocene record in the Levant enables us to examine the amplitude of variation within each techno-complex, as well as to question whether there are diachronic changes in the amplitude of techno-typological variations as well as changes in the manner by which they appear in the record. The results carry significant implications for understandings of demographic and societal processes during the Lower\textendash Middle Paleolithic transition in the Levant.},

Recent research has shown that the linkage between population size and cultural evolution is not straightforward and emerges from the interplay of many demographic, economic, social and ecological variables. Formal modelling has yielded interesting insights into the complex relationship between population structure, intergroup connectedness, and magnitude and extent of population extinctions. Such studies have highlighted the importance of effective (as opposed to census) population size in transmission processes. At the same time, it remained unclear how such insights can be applied to material culture phenomena in the prehistoric record, especially for deeper prehistory. In this paper we approach the issue of population sizes during the time of the Lower to Middle Paleolithic transition through the proxy of regional trajectories of lithic technological change, identified in the archaeological records from Africa, the Levant, Southwestern and Northwestern Europe. Our discussion of the results takes into consideration the constraints inherent to the archaeological record of deep time e e.g., preservation bias, time-averaging and the incomplete nature of the archaeological record e and of extrapolation from discrete archaeological case studies to an evolutionary time scale. We suggest that technological trajectories of change over this transitional period reflect the robustness of transmission networks. Our results show differences in the pattern and rate of cultural transmission in these regions, from which we infer that information networks, and their underlying effective population sizes, also differed.},

In this paper we discuss the composition, reduction technology, and raw material curation strategies represented in the assemblage. The assemblage is flake-dominated, with low frequencies of retouched artifacts and of cores. Several reduction sequences were identified. Products of Levallois methods appear in low frequencies. The modified artifacts include lightly retouched flakes and blades, side-scrapers, truncations and burins. The low frequencies of primary elements, core trimming elements, and cores suggest that only part of the reduction sequence took place on-site. Side-scrapers may have been imported into the locality. In contrast, short non-Levallois reduction sequences were applied on-site.},

Evaluation of rates of production over time suggests that at most a few thousand chert tools were produced per year at Colha, indicating a very low level of specialization, if any. The context of the chert debitage deposits is suggestive of domestic production for household use, rather than the ``industrial-level mass production'' postulated by Shafer and Hester.},

Occupation at the site began between 51,000 and 45,000 cal BP and continued into the Last Glacial Maximum, and throughout the Holocene. While CG1 has featured in several studies, the full complement of 100 radiocarbon dates is presented here for the first time in stratigraphic context, and a Bayesian model is used to evaluate the age sequence. We present analyses of the stone artefact and faunal assemblages from Square A2, the oldest and deepest square excavated. These data depict a remarkable record of adaptation in technology, mobility, and diet breadth spanning 47,000 years. We discuss the dating and settlement record from CG1 and other northern Australian sites within the context of the new dates for occupation of Madjedbebe in Arnhem Land at 65,000 years ({$\pm$}5700), and implications for colonisation and dispersal within Sahul.},

The extent and location of edge damage, interpreted as probable use-wear, is demonstrated to have distribution patterns consistent with multipurpose functions. Projectile use was merely one, albeit infrequent function of these versatile tools. This study uses use-wear data to engage with technological organisation theory and discusses rates of use, resharpening, rejuvenation and recycling.

  abstract = {In the Koobi Fora region of the northeast Lake Turkana Basin (Kenya) dozens of archeological sites have been studied for decades in order to understand the behavior of Early Pleistocene hominins. Data collected from these sites have been important for demonstrating the manufacture styles of Oldowan stone-tool users, hominin dietary preferences, and processes of Early Stone Age site formation. A particularly rich locality is collection Area 130. Area 130 is noteworthy for hominin fossils KNM-ER 1805 (Homo) and 1806 (Paranthropus) as well as the FxJj 18 site complex, which represents one of the type localities for the Developed Oldowan of Koobi Fora. However, despite research beginning in the late 1960s, and several revisions to the stratigraphy and dating of the Koobi Fora Formation, few published studies provide a detailed chronostratigraphy for Area 130. The lack of a detailed chronostratigraphy has contributed to conflicting interpretations for the dates of the hominin fossils and archaeological sites. Here we present new geochronologic and paleomagnetic data to develop a chronostratigraphic framework that allows us to directly assess the age of the sediments, fossils, and artifacts from Area 130. Individual pumices from the Orange Tuff marker level and a previously unnamed tuff exposed near the FxJj 18 (referred here as the FxJj 18 tuff) archaeological site complex were collected for high precision single crystal 40Ar/39Ar dating. Concurrently, we collected orientated paleomagnetic samples from stratigraphic levels of the KBS Member in Area 130 and used them to develop a magnetostratigraphic section. Our findings allow us to better constrain the stratigraphy of the analyzed sections and can be used to refine the sequence and chronology of the archaeological and fossils sites from Area 130 and other penecontemporaneous sites within the Lake Turkana Basin. Our data show that the first appearance of the Developed Oldowan for Koobi Fora does not correlate with any obvious evolutionary changes represented by the local hominin hypodigm nor with the arrival of a cognitively advanced hominin. Therefore we speculate that the advent of this more sophisticated type of stone tool was a response to a change in the diet of the genus Homo.},

  abstract = {The cha\^ines op\'eratoires underlying the manufacture of objects are good proxies for studying social groups and how cultural traits are transmitted and modified through the learning process. With the rise of evolutionary archaeology, the evolution of ceramic vessels can be modeled by using cladistics to elaborate kinship relationships between different taxa on the basis of shared derived character states. Here the modeling applies to ceramic fashioning from the European Middle Bronze Age (France and the United Kingdom). The aim is to assess the nature of the evolution and the relationships between three main cultures\textemdash in southern England, Normandy, and in the center-west of France. The cladistics analysis highlights that the ceramic traditions largely result from a process of phylogenesis\textemdash a result of descent with modification from an ancestral assemblage\textemdash rooted in the Early Bronze Age, suggesting a common origin for the Trevisker/Deverel-Rimbury and French Atlantic technical traditions. On the other hand, the Norman appears to be related to the Duffaits tradition, but to the exclusion of the Trevisker/Deverel-Rimbury traditions. This study supports the theoretical premise that some technical sequences are more stable than others. The evolution of sequences requiring motor habits, such as shaping, stabilized fairly quickly, unlike the finishing operations that continued to diverge throughout the Bronze Age. This study suggests that cladistics based on the description of the ceramic material in terms of cha\^ines op\'eratoires is a useful tool for studying cultural change.},

In this study, we compared strike-by-strike adjustment of percussive movements in expert bearded capuchin monkeys (Sapajus libidinosus) and (novice and expert) humans cracking palm nuts (Astrocaryum spp.) using stone hammers of varying mass. The monkeys regulated each strike's amplitude and hammer's velocity at impact to a small degree based on the propagation of a fracture in the nut's shell but overall struck a nut with consistent kinetic energy for a given hammer. They showed the smallest movement variability across strikes among all groups. Novice humans took the most strikes to crack a nut among all groups. Expert humans took the fewest strikes among all groups while showing the largest variation in hammer's kinetic energy at impact and largest movement variability across strikes. Overall, our findings confirm that expert humans can adjust their strikes more precisely to meet variable task demands and are more efficient than monkeys or novice humans in cracking nuts, but the findings also show a surprising advantage for expert monkeys over novice humans. The monkeys' strategy of striking with consistent amplitude and velocity is advantageous when hammer mass is adequate to generate sufficient kinetic energy at impact and crack open a nut in few strikes without requiring fine adjustments, explaining why the monkeys are particularly attentive to a stone's mass when choosing it as a hammer.},

Analyses of cranial data, on the other hand, have given mixed results-, and have been argued to support multiple origins of modern humans, , . Using a large dataset of skull measurements and an analytical framework equivalent to the one used for genetic data, we show that the loss in genetic diversity has been mirrored by a loss in phenotypic variability. We find evidence for an African origin, placed somewhere in the central/southern part of the continent, which harbours the highest intra-population diversity in phenotypic traits. We failed to find evidence for a second origin and confirm these results on a large genetic dataset. Distance from Africa accounts for an average 19\% - 25\% of heritable variation in craniometric traits, a remarkably strong effect for phenotypic traits known to be under selection.},

The scavenging interpretations rely primarily on several patterns in the faunal remains: the presence of a skeletal element pattern dominated by heads or head and foot parts, the presence of carnivore tooth marks on bone fragments, and infrequent cut marks that typically are not located on shaft regions of long bones or on fleshy bones. Five sites have been used to argue for scavenging: Klasies River Mouth, Combe Grenal, Grotta Guattari, Grotta dei Moscerini, and Grotte Vaufrey. The former four of the five sites are biased samples in that long bone shafts and other difficult to identify fragments were discarded at excavation. The analysis of Grotte Vaufrey included only those shafts identifiable to species or genus, thus excluding the vast majority of shaft specimens. This bias systematically shapes the skeletal element and surface modification patterning in ways that make the assemblages appear to fit a model of scavenging, when in fact the main determinant of the pattern is the bias in the flawed samples. This problem is illustrated with two unbiased faunal assemblages (Kobeh Cave and Die Kelders Layer 10). Skeletal element abundance is calculated in a way that mimics the bias in the sites listed above by excluding the shafts. Using this procedure, both Kobeh and Die Kelders have a head and foot skeletal element pattern and thus appear scavenged. Both assemblages are then analyzed in their entirety and a new pattern, consistent with hunting, is revealed. Taphonomic data on bone survival and destruction provide an explanation for this result. Excluding shaft fragments from the analysis also biases the surface modification patterning in such a way as to produce a pattern more consistent with scavenging. The conclusion is that there is no reliable evidence for scavenging by Neandertals or early modern humans.},

  abstract = {Modern humans are an anomaly in evolution, and the final key features occurred late in human evolution. Ultimate explanations for this evolutionary trajectory are best attained through synthetic studies that integrate genetics, biological anthropology, and archaeology, all resting firmly in the field of evolutionary anthropology. These fields of endeavor typically operate in relative isolation. This synthetic overview identifies the three pillars of human uniqueness: an evolved advanced cognition, hyperprosociality, and psychology for social learning. These properties are foundational for cumulative culture, the dominant adaptation of our species. Although the Homo line evolved in the direction of advancing cognition, the evidence shows that only modern humans evolved extreme levels of prosociality and social learning; this review offers an explanation. These three traits were in place {$\sim$}200\textendash 100 ka and produced a creature capable of extraordinary social and technological structures, but one that was also empowered to make war in large groups with advanced weapons. The advance out of Africa and the annihilation of other hominin taxa, and many unprepared megafauna, were assured.},

Four archaeological sites at Lukenya Hill in the savanna of the Athi-Kapiti Plains of Kenya that date to the last 40,000 yr preserve a large mammalian fauna. The prehistoric hunters concentrated on migratory ungulates and virtually ignored the resident inselberg ungulates throughout the occupation. Faunas of the last glacial maximum are dominated by an extinct small alcelaphine antelope. Arid-adapted ungulates are present that are regionally absent historically, and Pelorovis is present as well. The small alcelaphine and arid-adapted ungulates are absent in the Holocene deposits. This suggests that there was an expansion of dry savannas during the last glacial maximum. The last glacial maximum aridity, combined with a lack of pastoral-set fires, would have resulted in a vegetative mosaic distinct from the present. Dry woody growth and dry and/or tall grass, all of which are poor forage for ungulates, would have been common where seasonally moist short grasslands are presently extant. These conditions favored the large-bodied, highly hypsodont species in Africa that became extinct with the onset of wet conditions during the early Holocene.},

The foraging shift to dense and predictable resources is another key milestone that had consequential impacts on the later part of human evolution. The theory of economic defendability predicts that this shift had an important consequence\textemdash elevated levels of intergroup territoriality and conflict. In this paper, this theory is integrated with a well-established general theory of hunter\textendash gatherer adaptations and is used to make predictions for the sequence of appearance of several evolved traits of modern humans. The distribution of dense and predictable resources in Africa is reviewed and found to occur only in aquatic contexts (coasts, rivers and lakes). The palaeoanthropological empirical record contains recurrent evidence for a shift to the exploitation of dense and predictable resources by 110 000 years ago, and the first known occurrence is in a marine coastal context in South Africa. Some theory predicts that this elevated conflict would have provided the conditions for selection for the hyperprosocial behaviours unique to modern humans., This article is part of the themed issue `Major transitions in human evolution'.},

  abstract = {Fuel management during the Paleolithic periods is an important issue to understand past human subsistence. Numerous Palaeolithic sites relate an abundance of burnt bones in hearths and an absence or scarcity of wood charcoals, which leads studies to focus on burnt bone remains and the use of bones in hearths. Few works take into account the micro-residues of wood charcoals which can still be present in hearth areas and excavated sediments. We studied the Epigravettian site with mammoth bone dwellings of Mezhyrich (Ukraine) previously characterized by its high content of burnt bones and an ``absence'' of wood charcoal during the so-called mammoth steppe. The presence or absence and proportions of both wood charcoals and burnt bones were quantified in macro-, meso- and microscale sediment size fractions by an image analysis method. Our results show that excavations during field-works at Mezhyrich give only a partial image of the original anthracological record and that most charcoal materials are lost with standard archaeological and anthracological approaches. The scarcity of charcoals in this site was possibly due to an important mass reduction accentuated by the addition of bones in hearths. By applying our protocol we recovered a significant amount of wood charcoals which provides the first 14C dates from charcoals at Mezhyrich. Numerous charcoals are identified contributing subsequent information about vegetation, environment and burning practices. They indicate, by comparison with pollen data already collected, the presence of forest patches in a mammoth steppe landscape, which might have influenced the collecting behavior of Epigravettian populations.},

In what appear to be modified versions of the older migrationist arguments, contemporary thought within archaeology once more seems to allow that wholesale relocations were responsible for bringing farming into the region. It has been suggested, for example, that Northern Iroquoian speakers entered southern Ontario as recently as the early or middle centuries of the first millennium A.D. In this paper, I recount the routes this debate has taken and show that the appearance of maize (Zea mays) agriculture, alongside a few other materials, has come to be bound up with documenting the arrival of Northern Iroquoian-speaking communities. I conclude by reiterating the cautions advised by a number of researchers for how we read past ethnicity from archaeological materials and the role this plays in contemporary political discourse between First Nations and others.

            R\'esum\'e
            La visi\'on de la arqueolog\'ia sobre la propagaci\'on de la agricultura tiende a favorecer la difusi\'on de tipo (in)migracional/dermica o de desarrollo/estimulo in-situ. Habi\'endose alejado del modelo de principios del siglo 20 sobre la migraci\'on comunitaria como el origen del pueblo Iroqu\'es en la zona baja de los grandes lagos, y en particular en el sur de Ontario, la ortodoxia arqueol\'ogica ha llegado, durante el ultimo medio siglo, a ubicar en el \'area una poblaci\'on de habla iroqu\'es norte\~no desde al menos 2000 a\~nos atr\'as, e incluso posiblemente desde mucho antes. En lo que suena a modificaciones de los viejos argumentos migratorios, la arqueolog\'ia actual parece aceptar nuevamente que reubicaciones comunitarias fueron la causa de la aparici\'on de la agricultura en la regi\'on. Por ejemplo, se ha sugerido que ya en los siglos medios del primer milenio d.C. habitaban pobladores de habla iroqu\'es norte\~no en el sur de Ontario. Aqu\'i repaso los caminos que ha tomado este debate y demuestro que la aparici\'on de la agricultura de ma\'iz (Zea mays), junto con algunos otros materiales, ha llegado a entrelazarse con la documentaci\'on de la llegada de las comunidades de habla iroqu\'es. Concluyo reiterando el llamado a cautela sugerido por un n\'umero de investigadores sobre la manera en que determinamos la etnia de antiguos artefactos arqueol\'ogicos y la influencia que esto tiene en el discurso pol\'itico actual entre las primeras-naciones y otros.},

We propose that large nucleated communities, where domestic units have access to larger networks of household interaction, facilitate the development of more functional interdependent social institutions, while the small network of household interaction inherent to smaller villages and dispersed populations encourages functional redundancy in domestic units. To test these expectations, the compositions of communities in three prehistoric populations are compared through the use of multivariate icons (graphical depictions of the variation in artifact types for different household samples). The results indicate that more nucleated settlements have more pronounced indicators of functional interdependence within their constituent units.},

It has special global significance for its record of early pelagic fishing and ancient shell fish hooks. It is also of regional significance for its early occupation and comparatively large assemblage of Pleistocene stone artefacts. Three major findings arise from our study of the stone artefacts. First, there is little change in lithic technology over the 42,000 year sequence, with the most noticeable change being the addition of new artefact types and raw materials in the midHolocene. Second, the assemblage is dominated by small chert cores and implements rather than pebble tools and choppers, a pattern we argue pattern, we argue, that is common in island SE Asian sites as opposed to mainland SE Asian sites. Third, the Jerimalai assemblage bears a striking resemblance to the assemblage from Liang Bua, argued by the Liang Bua excavation team to be associated with Homo floresiensis. We argue that the near proximity of these two islands along the Indonesian island chain (c.100 km apart), the long antiquity of modern human occupation in the region (as documented at Jerimalai), and the strong resemblance of distinctive flake stone technologies seen at both sites, raises the intriguing possibility that both the Liang Bua and Jerimalai assemblages were created by modern humans.},

Another increase in raw material transfer occurred during the late Middle Stone Age in Africa (after about 130,000 years ago), suggesting the operation of exchange networks. Exchange networks require a communication system with syntax, the use of symbols in social contexts and the ability to express displacement, which are the features of human language. Taking the Neanderthals as a case study, biological evidence and the results of computer simulations of the evolution of language, I argue for a gradual rather than catastrophic emergence of language coinciding with the first evidence of exchange networks.},

An analysis of an experimentally produced Hoabinhian assemblage is undertaken here to show which flake variables are significant indicators of assemblage reduction intensity. The results show that recording the presence of overhang removal, interior platform angle, and percentage of dorsal cortex will provide robust data on the extent of assemblage reduction. A new method for detecting assemblage variation based on the location of dorsal cortex on flakes is also presented and experimentally verified. These methods are designed to take advantage of the typical geometry and reduction patterns of Hoabinhian assemblages. These findings provide another tool to build anthropological explanations of Hoabinhian archaeology.},

Could the Olduvai hand have made the tools? Did the human hand evolve as an adaptation to tool making and tool use? The debate has been fueled by anatomical studies comparing living and fossil human and nonhuman primate hands, and by experimental observations. These have assessed the relative abilities of apes and humans to manufacture the Oldowan tools, but consensus has been hampered by disagreements about how to translate experimental data from living species into quantitative models for predicting the performance of fossil hands. Such models are now beginning to take shape as new techniques are applied to the capture, management and analysis of data on kinetic and kinematic variables ranging from hand joint structure, muscle mechanics, and the distribution and density of bone to joint movements and muscle recruitment during manipulative behaviour. The systematic comparative studies are highlighting a functional complex of features in the human hand facilitating a distinctive repertoire of grips that are apparently more effective for stone tool making than grips characterising various nonhuman primate species. The new techniques are identifying skeletal variables whose form may provide clues to the potential of fossil hominid hands for one-handed firm precision grips and fine precision manoeuvering movements, both of which are essential for habitual and effective tool making and tool use.},

  abstract = {Laetoli is a well-known palaeontological locality in northern Tanzania whose outstanding record includes the earliest hominin footprints in the world (3.66 million years old), discovered in 1978 at Site G and attributed to Australopithecus afarensis. Here, we report hominin tracks unearthed in the new Site S at Laetoli and referred to two bipedal individuals (S1 and S2) moving on the same palaeosurface and in the same direction as the three hominins documented at Site G. The stature estimates for S1 greatly exceed those previously reconstructed for Au. afarensis from both skeletal material and footprint data. In combination with a comparative reappraisal of the Site G footprints, the evidence collected here embodies very important additions to the Pliocene record of hominin behaviour and morphology. Our results are consistent with considerable body size variation and, probably, degree of sexual dimorphism within a single species of bipedal hominins as early as 3.66 million years ago.
          , 
            Fossil footprints are extremely useful tools in the palaeontological record. Their physical features can help to identify their makers, but can also be used to infer biological information. How did the track-maker move? How large was it? How fast was it going?
            Footprints of hominins (namely the group to which humans and our ancestors belong) are pretty rare. Nearly all of the hominin footprints discovered so far are attributed to species of the genus Homo, to which modern humans belong. The only exceptions are the footprints that were discovered in the 1970s at Laetoli (in Tanzania) on a cemented ash layer produced by a volcanic eruption. These are thought to have been made by three members of the hominin species Australopithecus afarensis \textendash{} the same species as the famous ``Lucy'' from Ethiopia \textendash{} around 3.66 million years ago.
            The extent to which body shape and size varied between different members of Au. afarensis \textendash{} for example, between males and females \textendash{} has been the subject of a long debate among researchers. Based on the skeletal remains found so far in East Africa, some scholars believe that individuals only varied moderately, as in modern humans, while others state that it was pronounced, as in some modern apes like gorillas.
            Masao et al. have now unearthed new bipedal footprints from two individuals who were moving on the same surface and in the same direction as the three individuals who made the footprints documented in the 1970s. The estimated height of one of the new individuals (about 1.65 metres) greatly exceeds those previously published for Au. afarensis. This evidence supports the theory that body size varied considerably amongst individuals within the species.
            Masao et al. tentatively suggest that the new footprints can be considered as a whole with the 1970s ones. The tall individual may have been the dominant male of a larger group, the others smaller females and juveniles. Thus, considerable differences may have existed between males and females in these remote human ancestors, similar to modern gorillas.
            The newly discovered tracks are only 150 metres away from the previously discovered sets of footprints. This leaves open the possibility that additional tracks may be unearthed nearby that will further our knowledge about the variability and behaviour of our extinct ancestors.},

  abstract = {Background: Archaeologists and anthropologists have long recognized that different cultural complexes may have distinct descent histories, but they have lacked analytical techniques capable of easily identifying such incongruence. Here, we show how Bayesian phylogenetic analysis can be used to identify incongruent cultural histories. We employ the approach to investigate Iranian tribal textile traditions.
Methods: We used Bayes factor comparisons in a phylogenetic framework to test two models of cultural evolution: the hierarchically integrated system hypothesis and the multiple coherent units hypothesis. In the hierarchically integrated system hypothesis, a core tradition of characters evolves through descent with modification and characters peripheral to the core are exchanged among contemporaneous populations. In the multiple coherent units hypothesis, a core tradition does not exist. Rather, there are several cultural units consisting of sets of characters that have different histories of descent.
Results: For the Iranian textiles, the Bayesian phylogenetic analyses supported the multiple coherent units hypothesis over the hierarchically integrated system hypothesis. Our analyses suggest that pile-weave designs represent a distinct cultural unit that has a different phylogenetic history compared to other textile characters.
Conclusions: The results from the Iranian textiles are consistent with the available ethnographic evidence, which suggests that the commercial rug market has influenced pile-rug designs but not the techniques or designs incorporated in the other textiles produced by the tribes. We anticipate that Bayesian phylogenetic tests for inferring cultural units will be of great value for researchers interested in studying the evolution of cultural traits including language, behavior, and material culture.},

Lithic data from Pulltrouser Swamp are used to shed light on the production intensity and scale of a distribution system centered at Colha, Belize. Debitage analyses of technological attributes, use wear, and metric dimensions contrast two contexts of lithic procurement at Pulltrouser Swamp: direct procurement of raw material and indirect procurement of finished tools. Each procurement context results in debitage with different variable states. Characterization of the Colha chert lithic material at Pulltrouser Swamp as a consumer assemblage is supported further by the results of a discriminant analysis in which an experimental "consumer" assemblage is classified with the Colha chert. Such characterizations of lithic assemblages are more robust methodologically and more informative substantively than attempts at the quantification of production or usage rates. The implications of scalar differences in production systems are discussed.},

However, because the space of genotypes is typically high-dimensional, the structure of fitness landscapes can be difficult to understand and the heuristic approach of thinking about fitness landscapes as low-dimensional, continuous surfaces may be misleading. Here I present a rigorous method for creating low-dimensional representations of fitness landscapes. The basic idea is to plot the genotypes in a manner that reflects the ease or difficulty of evolving from one genotype to another. Such a layout can be constructed using the eigenvectors of the transition matrix describing the evolution of a population on the fitness landscape when mutation is weak. In addition, the eigendecomposition of this transition matrix provides a new, high-level view of evolution on a fitness landscape. I demonstrate these techniques by visualizing the fitness landscape for selection for the amino acid serine and by visualizing a neutral network derived from the RNA secondary structure genotype-phenotype map.},

Highquality direct evidence of this transition is rare. We report new interdisciplinary research at the archaeological site of Nan Madol that allows us to specify where and when people began to construct monumental architecture in the remote islands of the Pacific. Nan Madol is an ancient administrative and mortuary center and the former capital of the island of Pohnpei. It was constructed over 83 ha of lagoon with artificial islets and other architecture built using columnar basalt and coral. We employed geochemical sourcing of basalt used as architectural stone and high-precision uranium-thorium series dates (230Th/U) on coral from the tomb of the first chief of the entire island to identify the beginning of monument building at Nan Madol in AD 1180e1200. Over the next several centuries (AD 1300e1600) monument building began on other islands across Oceania. Future research should be aimed at resolving the causes of these social transformations through higher quality data on monument building.},

Here we use collections of obsidian artefacts that date to a period of endemic warfare among Maori during New Zealand's Late Period (1500\textendash 1769 A.D.) to determine what strategies people engaged in to obtain obsidian, namely (1) collecting raw material directly from a natural source, (2) informal trade and exchange, and (3) formal trade and exchange. These deposits represent a good cross-section of Late Period archaeology, including primary working of raw material at a natural source (Helena Bay), undefended sites where people discarded rubbish and worked obsidian (Bream Head), and a heavily fortified site (Mt. Wellington). We find that most of the obsidian described here was likely obtained directly from natural sources, especially those located on off-shore islands within about 60\textendash 70 km of sites. A smaller amount comes from blocks of material transported from an off-shore island a greater distance away, called Mayor Island, in a formal trade and exchange network. This study demonstrates the value of conducting tandem lithic technology and geochemical sourcing studies to understand how people create and maintain social networks during periods of warfare.},

Each depositional episode has two phases: an unstable phase with a high rate of deposition and no soil formation, followed by a stable phase with a low rate of deposition and soil formation. The Okawan, Kekerionean, and Waitangian episodes closely match late Holocene depositional episodes on the New Zealand mainland. The earliest human occupation remains (Moriori) are in Kekerionean sands and the inferred date for Moriori settlement of Chatham Island is between 400 and 450 years BP. Bones of Hooker's sea lion are found in Te Onean and Okawan deposits. The most recent bones are in Kekerionean middens and it is inferred that Hooker's sea lion was driven from the Chatham Islands by human predation. The depositional episodes appear to be unrelated to sea level changes, tectonic activity, or cultural influence. It is suggested that they may be related to coastal erosion initiated by storms.},

              Homo habilis
              to
              erectus
              , and from Oldowan to Acheulean technology. Bed II (\textasciitilde{} 1.8\textendash 1.2 Ma) is stratigraphically and environmentally complex, with facies changes, faulting, and unconformities, making site-to-site correlation over the \textasciitilde{} 20 km of exposure difficult. Bed II tuffs are thinner, less evenly preserved, and more reworked than those of Bed I. Five marker tuffs (Tuffs IIA\textendash IID, Bird Print Tuff (BPT)), plus local tephra, were collected from multiple sites and characterized using stratigraphic position, mineral assemblage, and electron probe microanalysis of phenocryst (feldspar, hornblende, augite, titanomagnetite) and glass (where available) composition. Lowermost Bed II tuffs are dominantly nephelinitic, Middle Bed II tuffs (BPT, Tuff IIC) have basaltic components, and upper Bed II Tuff IID is trachytic. The BPT and Tuff IID are identified widely using phenocryst compositions (high-Ca plagioclase and high-Ti hornblende, respectively), though IID was originally (Hay, 1976) misidentified as Tuff IIC at Loc 91 (SHK Annexe) in the Side Gorge. This work helps establish a high-resolution basin-wide paleolandscape context for the Oldowan\textendash Acheulean transition and helps link hominin, faunal and archaeological records.},

  abstract = {Tuffaceous marker beds, derived from volcanic products from the Ngorongoro Volcanic Highlands, help define a stratigraphic framework for the world-renowned fossil and stone tool record exposed at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania. However, previous efforts to constrain this tuff record, especially for Olduvai Bed II, have been limited because of erosion, contamination, reworking, and the alteration of volcanic glass under saline-alkaline conditions. This paper applies previously defined geochemical and mineralogical ``fingerprints'' for several major Bed II marker tuffs, based on glass (where available) and phenocrysts more resistant to alteration (feldspar, hornblende, augite, and titanomagnetite), to tuffs from stratigraphic sections in the Olduvai Junction Area, including previously and recently excavated Acheulean and Oldowan sites (HWK EE (Locality (Loc) 42), EF-HR (Loc 12a), FLK (Loc 45), and MNK (Loc 88)). The Middle Bed II Bird Print Tuff (BPT) is found to be more compositionally variable than previously reported but is still valuable as a stratigraphic marker over short distances. The confirmation of blocks of Tuff IID in conglomerate helps constrain Upper Bed II stratigraphy at sites where in-situ tuffs are absent. This paper also compiles the results of published geochronological research, providing stratigraphic context and updating previously reported dates using a consistent 40Ar/39Ar reference standard age. The results of this work support the following paleoanthropologically relevant conclusions: 1) the early Acheulean site EF-HR (Loc 12a) is situated above the level of Hay's Tuff IIC, and thus sits in Upper rather than Middle Bed II, (2) the HWK EE (Loc 42) Oldowan site is constrained between Tuff IIA and Tuff IIB, just above the boundary between Lower and Middle Bed II, and 3) the Acheulean site at FLK W most likely lies within the Middle Augitic Sandstone, above Tuff IIB, similar to the placements by Leakey and Hay for the earliest Acheulean at Olduvai.},

It was hoped that this time scale would form the basis for a regional chronology of early man sites in this section of the middle Atlantic. Given the success of the project in developing such a chronology, one of the first tasks was the development of morphological type descriptions for the artifacts to facilitate comparisons with sites from similar time periods. While functional and other kinds of artifact classifications are useful for archeological analysis, there is still a place for the classic morphological type as well in developing chronology.},

  abstract = {Functional analyses of stone tool assemblages face a number of methodological challenges. Aside from determining specific uses, it can be difficult to know which artifacts in an assemblage were used at all. Typically retouch is taken as a proxy for indicating past use, but ignoring unretouched flakes means excluding the overwhelming majority of most assemblages. Assessing whether an unretouched flake has been used is complicated. Edge damage on flakes can be caused by use or by taphonomic processes. One of the more important of these processes is trampling. Experiments have shown that trampling can create damage mimicking retouch, and unlike some other taphonomic processes trampling is otherwise difficult to detect. One possible solution is to look for patterning in the placement (left vs. right, ventral vs. dorsal, proximal vs. distal) of edge damage, and recent studies using GIS based approaches have shown the utility of this method at an assemblage level. Here we trampled a set of experimental flakes made from two raw materials on two substrate types and analyzed the edge damage patterns using a newly developed image analysis program that is similar to previous GIS based approaches. We found that a previously unquantified variable, edge angle, is strongly correlated with the likelihood of damage. Thus in circumstances where edge angles are non-randomly distributed across flake types, trampling damage will be patterned. These results have implications for previously published edge damage studies, and further indicate that basic flake mechanics need to be considered in studies where function is inferred from edge damage patterns. Approaches to the archaeological record that employs assemblage level assessments of edge damage, must consider a range of factors when inferring behaviors from these patterns.},

The recent, as yet unpublished, technological studies highlight a clear technological break between these two entities. In Hayonim, the Acheulo-Yabrudian assemblages found at the bottom of the archeological sequence display the specific combination of bifacial shaping and the production of thick, often cortical, flakes frequently shaped into scrapers by Quina retouch. Neither of these lithic production systems is observed in the succeeding Levantine Middle Paleolithic assemblages. In contrast, the Early Middle Paleolithic is characterized by the expansion and diversification of the Levallois production system in its full-fledged form, the emergence of a specific Laminar technology, and a high proportion of retouched tools made on elongated blanks (points and blades). These technological features are unknown in the previous Acheulo-Yabrudian assemblages in the cave. Based on this information, we attempt to determine if the observed changes in stone tool production strategies resulted from an autochthonous development or a dispersal out of Africa.},

nature and causes of the remarkable transformation in human behavioral patterns that
marked the transition from the Middle to the Upper Paleolithic in Europe.1\textendash 11 Those of
us who have argued for an effective technological and cultural ``revolution'' at this point
in the Paleolithic sequence have emphasized three main dimensions1,2,9,11\textendash 14: the wide
range of different aspects of behavior that appear to have been affected (Fig. 1); the
relative speed and abruptness with which most of these changes can be documented
in the archeological records from the different regions of Europe; and the potentially
profound social and cognitive implications of many of the innovations involved. Most
striking of all in this context is the abrupt appearance and proliferation of various forms
of perforated animal teeth, shells, beads, and other personal ornaments, and the even
more dramatic eruption of remarkably varied and sophisticated forms of art, ranging
from representations of male and female sex organs, through the highly stylized animal
and combined animal-human figures from southern Germany, to the striking wall
paintings of the Chauvet Cave.8,15\textendash 18 One might add to this the similar proliferation of
more enigmatic but potentially equally significant abstract ``notation'' systems on bone
and ivory artifacts.19 To describe the Upper Paleolithic revolution in Europe as reflecting preeminently an explosion in explicitly symbolic behavior and expression is in no
sense an exaggeration, as most prehistorians would now agree. We are probably on
safe ground in assuming that symbolic behavior and expression of this level of
complexity would be inconceivable in the absence of highly structured language

All the sites found in foothill context and the techno-typological study of these sites indicates many technological features that suggest the presence of Prehistoric human settlement in this region.},

  abstract = {To assess the integrity of Pleistocene archaeological sites is crucial in the analysis of human behaviour. Most of the Early Palaeolithic sites are in active fluvial environments where it is necessary to understand the degree of sedimentary disturbance. The analysis of the formation processes through geoarchaeological and geostatistical techniques offers new tools to evaluate if the archaeological assemblage is in autochthonous or allochthonous position. Gombore II, {$\approx$}850 Ka, within the archaeological and paleontological complex of Melka Kunture (Ethiopia), extends over estimated 1000 m2 and yielded a large number of Acheulean artefacts, fossil mammal bones and two fossil hominin remains. The geomorphological setting and deposition patterns of high-energy sedimentation in a fluvial channelized environment are similar to those of many other Early Palaeolithic African sites. This is traditionally described as producing a disturbed record, with the fortuitous association of faunal remains and lithic industry driven by fluvial processes. To assess this hypothesis, we analyse here the formation processes and the spatial patterning of the remains. We apply geoarchaeological (orientation and fabric) and spatial tests (density, grouping, k-means) to the mapped archaeological surfaces and to a present-day fluvial surface. We observe substantial differences in geoarchaeological features and spatial patterning between the archaeological record (lithic materials and faunal remains) and the natural clasts of both the archaeological deposit and the bed of the present-day river. This suggests different depositional processes or temporal events. We conclude that the remains produced by the hominins did not haphazardly accumulate after extensive erosion and re-sedimentation. They rather preserve a reasonable degree of taphonomic and spatial integrity and are possibly representative of different activities.},

Both technology and science are prime examples of cumulative cultural evolution, with each generation preserving and building upon the achievements of prior generations. A key benefit of an evolutionary approach to technological or scientific change is ``population thinking,'' where broad trends and patterns are explained in terms of individual-level mechanisms of variation, selection, and transmission. This chapter outlines some of these mechanisms and their implications for technological change, including sources of innovation, types of social learning, facilitatory developmental factors, and cultural transmission mechanisms. The role of external representations and human-constructed environments in technological evolution are explored, and factors are examined which determine the varying rates of technological change over time: from intrinsic characteristics of single technological traits, such as efficacy or manufacturing cost, to larger social and population-level factors, such as population size or social institutions. Science can be viewed as both a product of cultural evolution as well as a form of cultural evolution in its own right. Science and technology constitute separate yet interacting evolutionary processes. Outstanding issues and promising avenues for future investigation are highlighted and potential applications of this work are noted.},

  abstract = {Abstract
          How do migration and acculturation (i.e. psychological or behavioral change resulting from migration) affect within- and between-group cultural variation? Here I answer this question by drawing analogies between genetic and cultural evolution. Population genetic models show that migration rapidly breaks down between-group genetic structure. In cultural evolution, however, migrants or their descendants can acculturate to local behaviors via social learning processes such as conformity, potentially preventing migration from eliminating between-group cultural variation. An analysis of the empirical literature on migration suggests that acculturation is common, with second and subsequent migrant generations shifting, sometimes substantially, towards the cultural values of the adopted society. Yet there is little understanding of the individual-level dynamics that underlie these population-level shifts. To explore this formally, I present models quantifying the effect of migration and acculturation on between-group cultural variation, for both neutral and costly cooperative traits. In the models, between-group cultural variation, measured using F statistics, is eliminated by migration and maintained by conformist acculturation. The extent of acculturation is determined by the strength of conformist bias and the number of demonstrators from whom individuals learn. Acculturation is countered by assortation, the tendency for individuals to preferentially interact with culturally-similar others. Unlike neutral traits, cooperative traits can additionally be maintained by payoff-biased social learning, but only in the presence of strong sanctioning institutions. Overall, the models show that surprisingly little conformist acculturation is required to maintain realistic amounts of between-group cultural diversity. While these models provide insight into the potential dynamics of acculturation and migration in cultural evolution, they also highlight the need for more empirical research into the individual-level learning biases that underlie migrant acculturation.},

Here, I review current progress in the pursuit of an evolutionary science of culture that is grounded in both biological and evolutionary theory, but also treats culture as more than a proximate mechanism that is directly controlled by genes. Both genetic and cultural evolution can be described as systems of inherited variation that change over time in response to processes such as selection, migration, and drift. Appropriate differences between genetic and cultural change are taken seriously, such as the possibility in the latter of nonrandomly guided variation or transformation, blending inheritance, and one-to-many transmission. The foundation of cultural evolution was laid in the late 20th century with population-genetic style models of cultural microevolution, and the use of phylogenetic methods to reconstruct cultural macroevolution. Since then, there have been major efforts to understand the sociocognitive mechanisms underlying cumulative cultural evolution, the consequences of demography on cultural evolution, the empirical validity of assumed social learning biases, the relative role of transformative and selective processes, and the use of quantitative phylogenetic and multilevel selection models to understand past and present dynamics of society-level change. I conclude by highlighting the interdisciplinary challenges of studying cultural evolution, including its relation to the traditional social sciences and humanities.},

Existing approaches within anthropology and archaeology demonstrate a good match with the macroevolutionary methods of systematics, paleobiology, and biogeography, whereas mathematical models derived from population genetics have been successfully developed to study cultural microevolution. Much potential exists for experimental simulations and field studies of cultural microevolution, where there are opportunities to borrow further methods and hypotheses from biology. Potential also exists for the cultural equivalent of molecular genetics in ``social cognitive neuroscience,'' although many fundamental issues have yet to be resolved.

Yet previous analyses of cumulative cultural change have failed to consider the possibility that as cultural complexity accumulates, it becomes increasingly costly for each new generation to acquire from the previous generation. In principle this may result in an upper limit on the cultural complexity that can be accumulated, at which point accumulated knowledge is so costly and time-consuming to acquire that further innovation is not possible. In this paper I first review existing empirical analyses of the history of science and technology that support the possibility that cultural acquisition costs may constrain cumulative cultural evolution. I then present macroscopic and individual-based models of cumulative cultural evolution that explore the consequences of this assumption of variable cultural acquisition costs, showing that making acquisition costs vary with cultural complexity causes the latter to reach an upper limit above which no further innovation can occur. These models further explore the consequences of different cultural transmission rules (directly biased, indirectly biased and unbiased transmission), population size, and cultural innovations that themselves reduce innovation or acquisition costs.},

Here, we investigated the effect of multilevel sociality on cumulative cultural evolution by using wireless sensing technology to map inter- and intraband social networks among Agta hunter-gatherers. By simulating the accumulation of cultural innovations over the real Agta multicamp networks, we demonstrate that multilevel sociality accelerates cultural differentiation and cumulative cultural evolution. Our results suggest that hunter-gatherer social structures [based on (i) clustering of families within camps and camps within regions, (ii) cultural transmission within kinship networks, and (iii) high intercamp mobility] may have allowed past and present hunter-gatherers to maintain cumulative cultural adaptation despite low population density, a feature that may have been critical in facilitating the global expansion of Homo sapiens.
Hunter-gatherers from different bands form fluid social networks that facilitate cultural innovation through recombination of cultural traditions.

The second concerns the predominance ofcoarse-graitudraw materials (e.g. andesite), which are difficult to shape into formal tools. This study took a two-stage approach to test the hypotheses. An experimental study using andesite and chert flakes on bamboo, rattan and meat was conducted to identify probable microwear traces. The second stage involved microwear analysis ofprehistoric andesite and chert flakes from Minori Cave (Luzon). The experimental study showed that microwear analysis could be conducted on andesite flake tools. Microwear analysis showed that some ofthe prehistoric flakes were, in fact, used on hard contact materials. possiblybamboo.},

  abstract = {Distance decay is used to describe the (usually exponential) decay in ecological similarity of assemblages between two sites as a function of their distance apart along an environmental gradient. Exponential distance\textendash decay curves are routinely fitted by calculating the ecological similarity between each pair of sites, and fitting a linear regression to the points on a scatter plot of log-similarity vs. distance (x-axis). However, pairs of sites where the assemblages have no species in common pose a problem, because the similarity is zero, and the log transformation cannot be applied. Common fixes to this problem (i.e., either removing or transforming the zero values) are shown to have undesirable consequences and to give widely disparate estimates. A new method is presented as a special case of a generalized dissimilarity model. It is fitted very quickly and easily using existing software, and it does not require removal or transformation of the zero similarity points. Its simplicity makes it convenient for use in conjunction with the resampling methods that are routinely employed to test hypotheses, to obtain standard errors of estimated parameters, or to compare distance\textendash decay curves. A word of caution about standard application of the bootstrap is noted, and modified bootstrap and jackknife alternatives are demonstrated.},

However, recent excavations have also revealed the presence of three Early Mesolithic facies overlain by a Neolithic layer, while a Late Mesolithic presence is suggested for a fourth facies at the base of the terrace slope. Lithic and faunal analyses, as well as spatial analysis of the stratigraphic position of material recovered, indicate a clear separation of Mesolithic and Neolithic occupations. We present a new interpretation of the sequence of Holocene human occupations at Trou Al'Wesse in light of these data, arguing that the site was regularly occupied during the Early Mesolithic, forming a palimpsest of these visits, followed by an occupational hiatus and then reoccupation during the Late Mesolithic. The Early Neolithic is a separate occupation clearly unrelated to the Early Mesolithic underlying it, but ongoing fieldwork may recover data concerning the Final Mesolithic and its relation to the Early Neolithic at the site.},

These assumptions are key components of popular hypotheses about human life history evolution, but they have yet to be investigated phylogenetically. We applied two phylogenetic comparative methods to investigate whether these human life history traits differ from expectations based on other primates: one fits and selects between Brownian and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models of trait evolution; the other tests for phylogenetic outliers by predicting phenotypic characteristics based on trait covariation and phylogeny for a species of interest. We found that humans have exceptionally short interbirth intervals, long lifespans, and high birth masses. We failed to find evidence that humans have a delayed age at first reproduction relative to body mass or other covariates. Overall, our results support several previous assertions about the uniqueness of human life history characteristics and the importance of cooperative breeding and socioecology in human life history evolution. However, we suggest that several hypotheses about human life history need to be revised in light of our finding that humans do not have a delayed age at first reproduction.},

Previous interpretations have, however, been constrainedby a lack of tight stratigraphic associations. This paper describes the artefact assemblages dating to between 20 000 and 11 000 BP recovered from new, stratigraphically conducted excavations at the site. It is argued that a considerable stress on bladeletproduction is already evident at 20 000 BP and that all the assemblages described thus form part of the same Robberg-likemicrolithic tradition. The use of the -erm 'MSA9' to refer to the oldest of them (Carteret al. 1988) should therefore be abandoned. Bladelets may, however, have been hafted and/or used differently at 20 000 BP than in the terminal Pleistocene. A preliminary hypothesis is advanced as to how people may have used Sehonghong:the greater range of material culture evident after 12 500 BP suggests a possible shift at this timefrom a sporadically used hunting station to a home base status for the site.},

  abstract = {Formal spaces have become commonplace conceptual and computational tools in a large array of scientific disciplines, including both the natural and the social sciences. Morphological spaces (morphospaces) are spaces describing and relating organismal phenotypes. They play a central role in morphometrics, the statistical description of biological forms, but also underlie the notion of adaptive landscapes that drives many theoretical considerations in evolutionary biology. We briefly review the topological and geometrical properties of the most common morphospaces in the biological literature. In contemporary geometric morphometrics, the notion of a morphospace is based on the Euclidean tangent space to Kendall's shape space, which is a Riemannian manifold. Many more classical morphospaces, such as Raup's space of coiled shells, lack these metric properties, e.g., due to incommensurably scaled variables, so that these morphospaces typically are affine vector spaces. Other notions of a morphospace, like Thomas and Reif's (1993) skeleton space, may not give rise to a quantitative measure of similarity at all. Such spaces can often be characterized in terms of topological or pretopological spaces. The typical language of theoretical and evolutionary biology, comprising statements about the ``distance'' among phenotypes in an according space or about different ``directions'' of evolution, is not warranted for all types of morphospaces. Graphical visualizations of morphospaces or adaptive landscapes may tempt the reader to apply ``Euclidean intuitions'' to a morphospace, whatever its actual topology might be. We discuss the limits of metaphors such as the developmental hourglass and adaptive landscapes that ensue from the geometric properties of the underlying morphospace.},

Previous attempts of explaining the phenomenon by attributing its cause to factors such as differential access to resources and control over their distribution have been proven not to fit with the available body of evidence. The application of social network analysis-derived concepts and methods reveals that the topological locations that polities occupied generated different centralities, i.e. different degrees of connectedness to other polities and of mediating interactions between polities, which led to the hierarchisation and centralisation of their relationships. The paper concludes that the topological structure of a social network itself can be a significant cause of its own hierarchisation, and it compares the finding with the manner in which the concepts of agency and power are applied to the explanation of social hierarchisation and centralisation.},

  abstract = {In Mesoamerica concentrations of stone debitage from archaeological contexts frequently are regarded as being in primary contexts and marking production loci or ``workshops.''
            Ethnoarchaeological observations of stone- and glass-artifact manufacture and disposal of the resulting waste indicate that in sedentary societies debitage does not remain in primary context at workshops, but rather enters secondary context when it is moved into workshop dumps. Microdebitage, which often is left in place at the production locus, appears to be the most reliable indicator of workshop location.
            An awareness of ethnoarchaeological data can facilitate more plausible constructions of past behavior at different stages of the use-life trajectories of durable materials. Present evidence suggests that concentrations of stone debitage from archaeological settlements are secondary deposits and represent workshop dumps, not workshops.
          , 
            En Mesoam\'erica concentraciones de desechos l\'iticos en contextos arqueol\'ogicos frecuentemente est\'an considerados como talleres en contextos primarios, es decir, como lugares de fabricaci\'on.
            Los desechos l\'iticos occuren en seis tipos de colocaciones: mont\'iculos, basureros, microdesechos en pisos, rellenos arquitect\'onicos, dep\'ositos especiales como escondites y entierros, y en agregados fortuitos. Los datos de cinco estudios etnoarqueol\'ogicos son usados para interpretar estos dep\'ositos. Las observaciones de la producci\'on de artefactos l\'iticos y de la disposici\'on de desechos sugieron que los desechos l\'iticos nunca se dejan en contexto primario en talleres, sino que entran en contexto secundario cuando son trasladados a basureros de talleres. Muchas veces, los microdesechos se dejan en el piso del taller. Por ahora, estos microdesechos parecen ser los indicadores m\'as confiables de los lugares de fabricaci\'on.
            El conocimiento de datos etnoarqueol\'ogicos puede ayudarnos a reconstruir el comportamiento asociado con las etapas diferentes de la trayectoria de la vida de uso de materias duraderos. Por ahora, nuestro conocimiento indica que en Mesoam\'erica casi todos los dep\'ositos arqueol\'ogicos de desechos l\'iticos \'estan en contextos secundarios. Son basureros de talleres; no son los talleres. Los basureros de talleres nos proporcionan datos sobre el comportamiento de desechar, y pocos sobre el comportamiento de la producci\'on. Por conseguiente, los basureros no son fundamentos apropiados para la construcci\'on de hipoteses sobre los lugares o el volumen de producci\'on, la distribuci\'on residencial de los artesanos, el grado de la especializaci\'on, o los sistemas de la distribuci\'on de los artefactos. M\'as exactitud en la identificaci\'on de talleres y basureros l\'iticos nos facilitar\'a el acceso a su gran potencial para construir los sistemas culturales de Mesoam\'erica prehisp\'anica.},

They provide a means to combine multi-scalar and multidisciplinary data and thereby explore sites as a nexus of material relations. This paper outlines how such a site ego-network could be constructed. This is illustrated using the fourteenth century site of Kelbey's Ridge 2, Saba, in the North-eastern Caribbean. Kelbey's Ridge 2 is an interesting case study since it was likely a newly established, but also short-lived settlement. The reason for settlement may have been that, even if the island of Saba was relatively poor in terrestrial resources, it had a geographically strategic location and access to rich marine resources. Intra-site features at the site evidence a complex set of relations between house spaces and living and deceased members of the community. Additionally, the site's engagement with the wider island world is reflective of a transitional moment for communities in the late pre-colonial North-eastern Caribbean. A betweenness analysis of its ego-network provides a new perspective of Kelbey's Ridge 2, pinpointing material practices and objects that must have been crucial for the viability and identity of the community. This case study shows that ego-networks may be profitably used alongside current archaeological relational theories, substantive studies of site assemblages and other archaeological network approaches.},

It is suggested to reflect changes not just in tool form and innovative shaping, but also in planning depth, landscape use and social structures. This paper examines in detail the chronology of the first Acheulian industries in north-west Europe with the earliest sites from c. 700 ka through to later sites at c. 400 ka. It asks whether evidence from these sites can further our understanding of how the Acheulian and the bifacial technology emerged in this region, but more critically whether it was the underlying behavioural changes that enabled the more sustained occupation of northern latitudes. In particular the paper assesses whether cultural signatures can be identified and whether this reflects changes in group dynamics and social structures that could be a fundamental aspect of surviving in more seasonal, cooler climates.},

At Brinay (Cher department), the sandy alluvia of the Les Foug\`eres Formation that overlap the Acheulian Site of la Noira was dated par ESR Method of 665 {$\pm$} 55 ka. On this site, archaeological studies and excavations shown that hominins had prospected amounts of various weathered raw materials downsloping from the interfluve (Sub-Unit a1 / Unit a). Their strategy of supply seems to have consisted in several series of selections for gathering millstone slabs, while eliminating those which were previously alterated or frozen. These slabs were broken and the fragments were used for knapping flakes or shaping handaxes. During excavations, because of their freshness, evidence of primary position of these artifacts was observed. So, hominins were partially presents near by the river owing to reach raw materials. These in demand millstones are lacustrine silicifications that were uncovered during incision phase of the Cher river then sloped down in debris flows. These phenomena were resulting from climatic cyclicity and correspond to a transition phase at the beginning of a glacial stage and before pleniglacial stage (MIS 16) while the uncovered areas of Unit a and substratum were cryoturbated. In some valleys of the Middle Loire river Basin, others prehistoric assemblages were founded on the top of incision floors uncovered during different climatic cycles of the Early or Middle Pleistocene. Hominins activities on the alluvial plain food during the transition phase at the beginning of a glacial phase would be recurred cycle after cycle, but would be intermittent.},

  abstract = {The classic Mousterian Debate of the 1970s has recently been revived, as researchers propose cultural, functional, and chronological interpretations for the Mousterian ``technocomplexes''. These interpretations, however, are likely to lead to the same impasse that was previously reached forty years ago. The root cause of the problem is analyzing assemblages according to taxonomic units, whether they are Bordian facies or cha\^ine op eratoire technocomplexes, which conflate as well as mask multiple sources of variability. In this paper, we use a database of well-excavated, well-dated sites from the Middle and Upper Pleistocene in western Europe to track changes in key lithic variables through time. We show that the chronological patterning of typological and technological facies yields little information useful for elucidating the causes of Mousterian variability. When individual lithic variables from within assemblages are plotted through time, however, new patterns of variability emerge. Our results show that bifaces are not characteristic only of the ``Acheulean'' and the ``Mousterian of Acheulean Tradition.'' They occur continuously and in low frequencies across the European landscape from MIS 14 onwards. Second, we reveal chronological patterning in Levallois technology, which reaches a height of popularity between MIS 6e4. In the future, more progress in understanding technological behavior during the Paleolithic will be made if we compare the properties of the lithics themselves across assemblages, rather than comparing assemblage types.},

The reduction sequence practiced throughout the Pleistocene was straightforward and unchanging. Large flakes were produced off-site and carried into the cave where they were reduced centripetally and bifacially by four techniques: freehand, burination, truncation, and bipolar. The locus of technological complexity at Liang Bua was not in knapping products, but in the way techniques were integrated. This reduction sequence persisted across the Pleistocene/Holocene boundary with a minor shift favoring unifacial flaking after 11ka. Other stone-related changes occurred at the same time, including the first appearance of edge-glossed flakes, a change in raw material selection, and more frequent fire-induced damage to stone artifacts. Later in the Holocene, technological complexity was generated by ``adding-on'' rectangular-sectioned stone adzes to the reduction sequence. The Pleistocene pattern is directly associated with Homo floresiensis skeletal remains and the Holocene changes correlate with the appearance of Homo sapiens. The one reduction sequence continues across this hominin replacement.},

  abstract = {Stone-flaking technology is the most enduring evidence for the evolving cognitive abilities of our early ancestors. Flake-making was mastered by African hominins \textasciitilde 3.3 ma, followed by the appearance of handaxes \textasciitilde 1.75 ma and complex stone reduction strategies by \textasciitilde 1.6 ma. Handaxes are stones flaked on two opposed faces (`bifacially'), creating a robust, sharp-edged tool, and complex reduction strategies are reflected in strategic prior flaking to prepare or `predetermine' the nature of a later flake removal that served as a tool blank. These technologies are interpreted as major milestones in hominin evolution that reflect the development of higherorder cognitive abilities, and the presence and nature of these technologies are used to track movements of early hominin species or `cultures' in the archaeological record. However, the warranting argument that certain variations in stone tool morphologies are caused by differences in cognitive abilities relies on analogy with technical replications by skilled modern stoneworkers, and this raises the possibility that researchers are projecting modern approaches to technical problems onto our non-modern hominin ancestors. Here we present the results of novel experiments that randomise flake removal and disrupt the modern stoneworker's inclination to use higher-order reasoning to guide the stone reduction process. Although our protocols prevented goal-directed replication of stone tool types, the experimental assemblage is morphologically standardised and includes handaxe-like `protobifaces' and cores with apparently `predetermined' flake removals. This shows that the geometrical constraints of fracture mechanics can give rise to what appear to be highly-designed stoneworking products and techniques when multiple flakes are removed randomly from a stone core.},

These strategies, called ``grammars of action,'' are initially similar followed by an ontogenetic divergence in children that leads to a separation of complex linguistic and action grammars. Thus, more complex grammars arose after the emergence of the hominin lineage. Stone tools are by-products of action grammars that track the evolutionary history of hominin cognition, and this study develops a model of the essential motor actions of stoneworking interpretable in action grammar terms. The model shows that controlled flaking is achieved through integral sets of geometrical identifications and motor actions collectively referred to as the ``flake unit.'' The internal structure of the flake unit was elaborated early in technological evolution and later trends involved combining flake units in more complex ways. Application of the model to the archaeological record suggests that the most complex action grammars arose after 270 kya, although significant epistemological issues in stone artifact studies prevent a more nuanced interpretation.},

Two studies initiated by Forestry Tasmania provided the opportunity to examine Tasmanian lithic technology in eastern Tasmania and the Southern Forests. The results of the studies indicate that two strategies of stone procurement and reduction were practiced in both parts of the state. One strategy involved collecting small cobbles and pebbles from surface exposures. These stones were reduced off-source by freehand or bipolar percussion into small flake blanks. The blanks were used as cutting tools or retouched into scrapers. Many of the scrapers produced on these blanks fall within the "thumbnail" typological category. The other strategy involved reducing large blocks of material on-source into large flake blanks. These large flake blanks were exported and used as cutting tools, reduced as small cores, or, most often, retouched into large scrapers. In contrast to most small scrapers originating from transported cores, these large scrapers were resharpened prior to discard. The expression of these strategies differs between the two project areas. The off-source reduction strategy appears to be present in Pleistocene assemblages and the on-source strategy may have emerged in the Holocene.},

A significant proportion of the obsidian in these areas could have been procured by direct access, which may be reflected in a high percentage of artefacts with remnant cortex.

A differentiation has long been made between assemblages of large-sized ``core tools'' and assemblages of small-sized ``flake tools.'' ``Core tool'' assemblages are often argued to be the handiwork of early hominin species such as Homo erectus, while small-sized ``flake tool'' assemblages have been attributed to Homo sapiens. We argue that this traditional Southeast Asian perspective on stone tools assumes that the artifacts recovered from a site reflect a complete technological sequence. Our analyses of Pleistocene-age artifact assemblages from Flores, Indonesia, demonstrate that large pebblebased cores and small flake-based cores are aspects of one reduction sequence. We propose that the Flores pattern applies across island Southeast Asia: large-sized ``core tool'' assemblages are in fact a missing element of the small-sized flake-based reduction sequences found in many Pleistocene caves and rock-shelters. We conclude by discussing the implications of this for associating stone-artifact assemblages with hominin species in island Southeast Asia.},

Culturally, it is defined by the Late Middle Paleolithic succession, and by Early Upper Paleolithic complexes like the Cha\textasciicircum{} telperronian (southwestern Europe), the Protoaurignacian, and the Early Aurignacian. Up to now, the southern boundary for the transition has been established as being situated between France and Iberia, in the Cantabrian fac\c ade and Pyrenees. According to this, the central and southern territories of Iberia are claimed to have been the refuge of the last Neanderthals for some additional millennia after they were replaced by anatomically Modern Humans on the rest of the continent. In this paper, we present the Middle-toUpper Paleolithic transition sequence from Cova Foradada (Tarragona), a cave on the Catalan Mediterranean coastline. Archaeological research has documented a stratigraphic sequence containing a succession of very short-term occupations pertaining to the Cha\textasciicircum{} telperronian, Early Aurignacian, and Gravettian. Cova Foradada therefore represents the southernmost Cha\textasciicircum{} telperronian\textendash Early Aurignacian sequence ever documented in Europe, significantly enlarging the territorial distribution of both cultures and providing an important geographical and chronological reference for understanding Neanderthal disappearance and the complete expansion of anatomically Modern Humans.},

We define a multi-evidence-based approach that combines use-wear intensity and location, traces that could be related to hafting and the distribution of mineral residue. By combining these methods, we have observed a minimum resharpening ratio of 52\% in the selected end-scraper sample. If one takes into account ethnographically obtained information about end-scraper management, this result is an unexpectedly low value. Dynamics of mobility, technological organization and raw material availability causes high variability in the archaeological visibility and characteristics of lithic remains. Our results are in line with a technology organized wholly or partially on the basis of expediency, in which tools are not curated for more than the time taken to complete the activity or the length of the occupation. Tools that were not exhausted were abandoned at the site, leading to recycling behaviors in periodic site reoccupations.},

  abstract = {Humans possess an unusual combination of traits, including our cognition, life history, demographics and geographical distribution. Many theories propose that these traits have coevolved. Such hypotheses have been explored both theoretically and empirically, with experiments examining whether human behaviour meets theoretical expectations. However, theory must make assumptions about the human mind, creating a potentially problematic gap between models and reality. Here, we employ a series of `experimental evolutionary simulations' to reduce this gap and to explore the coevolution of learning, memory and childhood. The approach combines aspects of theory and experiment by inserting human participants as agents within an evolutionary simulation. Across experiments, we find that human behaviour supports the coevolution of learning, memory and childhood, but that this is dampened by rapid environmental change. We conclude by discussing both the implications of these findings for theories of human evolution and the utility of experimental evolutionary simulations more generally.

  abstract = {Drastic climate fluctuations occurred during the Late Glacial (LG), around 15,000\textendash 11,500~cal~BP also in the Japanese Archipelago. Although some studies have claimed that regional differences in the characteristics of lithic technology and human behavior became apparent at this period, recent studies have revealed that they were already apparent as early as the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Hence, it is important to discuss whether or not the regionality of the LGM had changed by the LG, and to understand the socioecologial processes of the Pleistocene/Holocene transition. This paper aims to review lithic technological variation in the Japanese Archipelago before and during the LG, and to investigate behavioral diversity in detail, focusing on the Kyushu region in southwestern Japan. As the result of the analysis, there are clear differences between northern and southern Kyushu in terms of lithic technology and behavioral strategy. The differences between the two regions continued from the LGM to LG. Low lithic tool diversity in the northern Kyushu indicates high mobility frequency of humans who carried them. In addition, a high degree of curated reduction strategy, and non-local high quality lithic raw material use also implies a high magnitude of mobility. Curated microblade technology had long helped humans to transport and utilize obsidian lithic resources in a wide foraging territory. This supposition would be supported by the scarcity of archaeological feature there, as well. By contrast, plenty of archaeological features including trap-pits and pit-dwellings in southern Kyushu implies, as many previous studies claimed, slightly early establishment of sedentary life-way of human groups who inhabited there. High lithic tool diversity in the southern Kyushu means low mobility frequency of humans who carried them, and moreover, the low degree of standardization of flake removal technique, low degree of curated reduction strategy, and the scarcity of use of exotic lithic raw materials all strongly denote that their mobility magnitude was also considerably low. They must have adopted fine-grained resource exploitation strategies in small foraging territories. It is supposed that above differences of behavioral strategy could be explained as different adaptations to different regional environmental settings. Future investigation would clarify more detailed regional adaptation strategy than ever.},

I provide a direct comparison of anthropology datasets with both phenotype and genotype datasets from biology. The anthropology datasets fit the tree model approximately as well as do the genotype data, which is detectably worse than the fit of the phenotype data. This is true for datasets with {$<$}500 parsimony-informative characters, as well as for larger datasets. This implies that cross-cultural (horizontal) processes have been important in the evolution of cultural artifacts, as well as branching historical (vertical) processes, and thus a phylogenetic network will be a more appropriate model than a phylogenetic tree.},

  abstract = {New in Paper! Excavated in 1974, the Sloan site in northeast Arkansas is the earliest recognized cemetery in the New World, containing the graves of a small group of Native Americans who died over ten thousand years ago. Although no skeletons were found in the acidic soil, the number, size, and quality of its artifacts attest to the presence of a far more complicated and sophisticated culture than had previously been thought to exist during the Dalton period. Bringing together the work of thirteen eminent scholars, Dan F. Morse describes and assesses the assemblage of points, adzes, scrapers, abraders, and other stone artifacts as an indicator of the territorial stability of late Pleistocene peoples. The tools show that hunter-gatherer-fisher populations lived in small, semipermanent villages, hunted and butchered white-tailed deer, processed and ate vegetables, and made dugout canoes. And they buried their dead in cemeteries, a practice previously associated only with the rise of horticultural societies. Many of the tools are unused, suggesting ritual interments and a well-developed system of trade with groups in rockier areas. Including an overview of the Dalton period in the southeastern United States and a discussion of the region's geologic and vegetal prehistory\textemdash and newly supported by extensive high-quality image galleries now available at the website of the Arkansas Archeological Survey (see inside cover)\textemdash this comprehensive study of the Sloan artifacts provides a multifaceted assessment of a site rich in information about the technology of a single prehistoric society.},

  abstract = {The discovery of new fossils in Africa, Asia, and Europe, and the recognition of a greater diversity in the middle Pleistocene fossil record, has led to a reconsideration of the species Homo heidelbergensis. This nomen, formulated by Schoetensack in 1908 to describe the Mauer jaw (Germany), was almost forgotten during most of the past century. Numerous fossils have been attributed to it but no consensus has arisen concerning their classification. The holotype anatomical traits are still poorly understood, and numerous fossils with no mandibular remains have been placed in the taxon. Some researchers propose H. heidelbergensis as an Afro-European taxon that is ancestral to both modern humans and Neandertals whereas others think it is a strictly European species that is part of the Neandertal lineage. We focus on the validity of H. heidelbergensis, using the traditional basis of species recognition: anatomical description. We provide a comparative morphological analysis using 47 anatomical traits of 36 Pleistocene fossils from Africa, Asia, and Europe and 35 extant human mandibles. We re-examine the mandibular features of Mauer and discuss the specimen's inclusion in H. heidelbergensis, as well as alternative evolutionary theories. To lend objectivity to specimen grouping, we use multiple correspondence analysis associated with hierarchical classification that creates clusters corresponding to phenetic similarities between jaws. Our phenetic and comparative morphological analyses support the validity of H. heidelbergensis as a taxon. A set of morphological features can be statistically identified for the definition of the species. Some traits can be used to delimit H. heidelbergensis in an evolutionary framework (e.g., foramina mentale posteriorly positioned, horizontal retromolar surface). Those traits are also present on African (e.g., Tighenif) and European (e.g., Sima de los Huesos) specimens that show a close relationship with the Mauer mandible. Therefore, the definition of H. heidelbergensis is more precise and mainly supports the theory of an Afro-European taxon, which is the last common ancestor of H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens. However, the results of this study fail to entirely discount the hypothesis that considers H. heidelbergensis as a chronospecies leading to the Neandertals.},

  abstract = {Africa is the birthplace of the species Homo sapiens, and Africans today are genetically more diverse than other populations of the world. However, the processes that underpinned the evolution of African populations remain largely obscure. Only a handful of late Pleistocene African fossils (\textasciitilde 50-12 Ka) are known, while the more numerous sites with human fossils of early Holocene age are patchily distributed. In particular, late Pleistocene and early Holocene human diversity in Eastern Africa remains little studied, precluding any analysis of the potential factors that shaped human diversity in the region, and more broadly throughout the continent. These periods include the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), a moment of extreme aridity in Africa that caused the fragmentation of population ranges and localised extinctions, as well as the `African Humid Period', a moment of abrupt climate change and enhanced connectivity throughout Africa. East Africa, with its range of environments, may have acted as a refugium during the LGM, and may have played a critical biogeographic role during the heterogene`ous environmental recovery that followed. This environmental context raises a number of questions about the relationships among early Holocene African populations, and about the role played by East Africa in shaping late hunter-gatherer biological diversity. Here, we describe eight mandibles from Nataruk, an early Holocene site (\textasciitilde 10 Ka) in West Turkana, offering the opportunity of exploring population diversity in Africa at the height of the `African Humid Period'. We use 3D geometric morphometric techniques to analyze the phenotypic variation of a large mandibular sample. Our results show that (i) the Nataruk mandibles are most similar to other African hunter-fisher-gatherer populations, especially to the fossils from Lothagam, another West Turkana locality, and to other early Holocene fossils from the Central Rift Valley (Kenya); and (ii) a phylogenetic connection may have existed between these Eastern African populations and some Nile Valley and Maghrebian groups, who lived at a time when a Green Sahara may have allowed substantial contact, and potential gene flow, across a vast expanse of Northern and Eastern Africa.},

An estimated time scale based on five 14C ages records approximately 38,000 yr. This palaeorecord is the first from this biodiversity hotspot and importantly extends through the last glacial maximum (LGM). The altitudinal transition from montane to upper montane forest shifted from 1700\textendash 1800 m (38,000 14C yr BP) to 1800\textendash 1900 m (35,000\textendash 29,000 14C yr BP). From 29,000 to 10,000 14C yr BP, it shifted from 1850\textendash 1950 m across the LGM to 1750\textendash 1800 m (during 10,000\textendash 3500 14C yr BP), and to present-day elevations at 2000 m during the last 3500 14C yr BP. The relative ecosystem stability across the LGM may be explained by the Indian Ocean's influence in maintaining continuous moist forest cover during a period of East African regional climate aridity. During the late Holocene, presence of abundant coprophilous fungi and algal blooms demonstrates increasing human impact. Neurospora spores indicate frequent fires, coinciding with clear signals of decline in Podocarpus and Psychotria trees that possibly represent selective logging.},

Mousterian occupation of the area probably terminated by 43,000 B.C. because this is the date for the Middle to Upper Paleolithic transition site of Boker Tachtit. Observations on the technological characteristics of the lithic debris indicate patterning that is useful for clarifying technological trends in the Levantine Mousterian in generai. Temporal shifts in flake shape and core preparation seem to be related and change in both is related to change in occupation intensity at Nahal Aqev, a Mousterian "base-camp". A model is proposed to account for technological change in the Levantine Mousterian in which temporal change in flake shape and core preparation is related to demographie and subsistance shifts that accompanied climatic and environmental shifts during the early Wurm. This model is significant because it proposes an early date for the advent of the Levantine Mousterian, that the earliest Mousterian may have been approximately contemporary with the Yabrudian and Amudian technocomplexes, and that the Mousterian sequence at Tabun may be incomplete.},

  abstract = {Practice theoretic approaches to archaeological interpretation aim to solve scalar puzzles of structure and agency by employing a set of metaphors that invoke networked relations between people and things in the past. One recent example of this approach, termed ``social stratigraphy,'' offers an alternative to analyzing deeply buried and stratified architectural contexts by emphasizing the recursive social and physical actions of construction, which generate webs of human interaction (McAnany and Hodder, Archaeological Dialogues 16(1):1\textendash 22, 2009). In order to ensure that such descriptive metaphors align with our empirical observations, archaeologists need to account for the varied ways that social action and architectural practice intersect along multiple axes of variation (i.e., material, spatial, and temporal). By analyzing the interconnected spatial and temporal dimensions of past built environments, this paper suggests that relational concepts can offer more than heuristic functions for archaeological discourse. I offer a set of formal methods related to quantitative social network analyses as one way to operationalize, and thereby strengthen, such metaphors as applied to archaeological interpretation. These techniques are demonstrated using recent excavation data from multiple stratified architectural contexts at a minor temple center located in the Pasi\'on region of the southern Maya lowlands to infer synchronous episodes of construction over a period of 1,600 years (850BCE\textendash 850CE). Results of this study demonstrate that issues of spatiotemporal variability can be resolved at a microscale by formally applying network concepts to archaeological analysis.},

Vying for power, elites legitimized their status by claiming ancestry from various supernaturals and engaged in conspicuous displays of competition, warfare, and ritual practice which were often recorded on stone monuments. By examining the inscribed relationships between Maya centers, we chart organizational changes in sociopolitical networks throughout the Classic period. Methods derived from social network analysis are used to examine temporal changes in the distribution and centralization of political power through different network interactions. We examine the intersection of antagonistic, diplomatic, subordinate, and kinship relationships and discuss how these overlapping networks contributed to dynamic changes in the Classic period. This case study demonstrates how current network analysis techniques can contribute to archaeological studies of the scalar dynamics and organizational changes of past social and political systems.},

  abstract = {Objectives Acquiring tool-assisted foraging skills can potentially improve dietary quality and increase fitness for wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). In contrast to chimpanzees in East and West Africa, chimpanzees in the Congo Basin use tool sets and brush-tipped fishing probes to gather termites. We investigated the ontogeny of these tool skills in chimpanzees of the Goualougo Triangle, Republic of Congo, and compared it to that for chimpanzees at Gombe, Tanzania. We assessed whether chimpanzees acquired simple tool behaviors and single tool use before more complex actions and sequential use of multiple tool types. Materials and Methods Using a longitudinal approach, we scored remote video footage to document the acquisition of termite-gathering critical elements for 25 immature chimpanzees at Goualougo. Results All chimpanzees termite fished by 2.9 years but did not manufacture brush-tipped probes until an average of 4.3 years. Acquisition of sequential tool use extended into juvenility and adolescence. While we did not detect significant sex differences, most critical elements except tool manufacture were acquired slightly earlier by females. Discussion These findings contrast with Gombe, where chimpanzees learn to both use and make fishing probes between ages 1.5\textendash 3.5 and acquire the complete task by age 5.5. Differences between sites could reflect tool material selectivity and design complexity, the challenge of sequential tool behaviors, and strength requirements of puncturing subterranean termite nests at Goualougo. These results illustrate how task complexity may influence the timing and sequence of skill acquisition, improving models of the ontogeny of tool behavior among early hominins who likely used complex, perishable technologies.},

  abstract = {Cumulative culture is a transformative force in human evolution, but the social underpinnings of this capacity are debated. Identifying social influences on how chimpanzees acquire tool tasks of differing complexity may help illuminate the evolutionary origins of technology in our own lineage. Humans routinely transfer tools to novices to scaffold their skill development. While tool transfers occur in wild chimpanzees and fulfill criteria for teaching, it is unknown whether this form of helping varies between populations and across tasks. Applying standardized methods, we compared tool transfers during termite gathering by chimpanzees in the Goualougo Triangle, Republic of Congo, and in Gombe, Tanzania. At Goualougo, chimpanzees use multiple, different tool types sequentially, choose specific raw materials, and perform modifications that improve tool efficiency, which could make it challenging for novices to manufacture suitable tools. Termite gathering at Gombe involves a single tool type, fishing probes, which can be manufactured from various materials. Multiple measures indicated population differences in tool-transfer behavior. The rate of transfers and probability of transfer upon request were significantly higher at Goualougo, while resistance to transfers was significantly higher at Gombe. Active transfers of tools in which possessors moved to facilitate possession change upon request occurred only at Goualougo, where they were the most common transfer type. At Gombe, tool requests were typically refused. We suggest that these population differences in tool-transfer behavior may relate to task complexity and that active helping plays an enhanced role in the cultural transmission of complex technology in wild apes.},

In this study, we show that wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) in the Goualougo Triangle teach tool skills by providing learners with termite fishing probes. Tool donors experienced significant reductions in tool use and feeding, while tool recipients significantly increased their tool use and feeding after tool transfers. These transfers meet functional criteria for teaching: they occur in a learner's presence, are costly to the teacher, and improve the learner's performance. Donors also showed sophisticated cognitive strategies that effectively buffered them against potential costs. Teaching is predicted when less costly learning mechanisms are insufficient. Given that these chimpanzees manufacture sophisticated, brush-tipped fishing probes from specific raw materials, teaching in this population may relate to the complexity of these termite-gathering tasks.},

These sessions happen after dinner and before the toddlers fall asleep, when family members spend the evening in the camp, socialising. All action focused on the toddlers during this time has to do with inducing and relieving fear. I relate these sessions to others described in the anthropology of Aboriginal Australia and read them as part of larger processes of social learning through which Warlpiri children acquire understanding of their world and how they fit into it.},

Technological and typological affinities are discernible from a direct comparison of tools from this assemblage with those found in Tabun layer D, as well as metrical and categorical comparisons between `Ain Difla and other well-known Tabun D Mousterian sites. The `Ain Difla sample is dominated by elongated Levallois points. Blanks were obtained from both uni- and bipolar convergent and predominantly Levallois cores that show evidence of bidirectional flaking. The typological and technological comparisons reported here suggest that the evolution of the blade-rich Mousterian can be viewed as a continuum between the early (Tabun) and late (Boker Tachtit) Mousterian; that (on any index) `Ain Difla falls somewhere around the middle of this continuum, and that Mousterian laminar technologies develop more or less continually into the early Upper Paleolithic Ahmarian.},

  abstract = {In the last few million years, the hominin brain more than tripled in size. Comparisons across evolutionary lineages suggest that this expansion may be part of a broader trend toward larger, more complex brains in many taxa. Efforts to understand the evolutionary forces driving brain expansion have focused on climatic, ecological, and social factors. Here, building on existing research on learning, we analytically and computationally model the predictions of two closely related hypotheses: The Cultural Brain Hypothesis and the Cumulative Cultural Brain Hypothesis. The Cultural Brain Hypothesis posits that brains have been selected for their ability to store and manage information, acquired through asocial or social learning. The model of the Cultural Brain Hypothesis reveals relationships between brain size, group size, innovation, social learning, mating structures, and the length of the juvenile period that are supported by the existing empirical literature. From this model, we derive a set of predictions\textemdash the Cumulative Cultural Brain Hypothesis\textemdash for the conditions that favor an autocatalytic take-off characteristic of human evolution. This narrow evolutionary pathway, created by cumulative cultural evolution, may help explain the rapid expansion of human brains and other aspects of our species' life history and psychology., Humans have extraordinarily large brains, which tripled in size in the last few million years. Other animals also experienced a significant, though smaller, increase in brain size. These increases are puzzling, because brain tissue is energetically expensive\textemdash a smaller brain is easier to maintain in terms of calories. Here we present a theory, captured in an analytic and computational model, that explains these increases in brain size: The Cultural Brain Hypothesis. The theory relies on the idea that brains expand to store and manage more information. Brains expand in response to the availability of information and calories. Information availability is affected by learning strategies (e.g. learning from others or learning by yourself), group size, mating structure, and the length of the juvenile period, which co-evolve with brain size. The model captures this co-evolution under different conditions and describes the specific and narrow conditions that can lead to a take-off in brain size\textemdash a possible pathway that led to the extraordinary expansion in our own species. We call these conditions the Cumulative Cultural Brain Hypothesis. These theories are supported by our tests using existing empirical data.},

Here we argue that the roots of cross-cultural variation often lie in the past. Therefore, to understand not just the way, but also why psychology varies, we also need to grapple with cross-temporal variation. Psychology needs to become a historical science. The traces of past human cognition accessible through historical texts and artifacts can also serve as a valuable, and yet currently almost completely unutilized, source of psychological data. This data from dead minds opens up a new and untapped, highly diverse subject pool. The cohort effects we measure are a sliver of the temporal variation we should expect over history. We review examples of research that may be classified as historical psychology, introduce sources of data and methods for analyzing historical data, explain for the critical role of theory, and discuss the variety of ways in which psychologists can add historical depth and nuance to their work. Historical psychology is a critical next step toward becoming a genuinely universal science.},

Chronic wasting disease among cervids and African swine fever among wild boar are emerging wildlife diseases in Europe, with huge economic and cultural repercussions. Understanding hunter movements at broad scales has implications for how to control the spread of these diseases. Here we show, based on analysis of the settlement patterns and movements of hunters of reindeer (n\,=\,9,685), red deer (n\,=\,47,845), moose (n\,=\,60,365) and roe deer (n\,=\,42,530) from across Norway (2001\textendash 2017), that hunter density was more closely linked to human density than prey density and that hunters were largely migratory, aggregated with increasing regional prey densities and often used dogs. Hunter movements extended across Europe and to other continents. Our results provide extensive evidence that the broad-scale movements and residency patterns of postindustrial hunters relative to their prey differ from those of large carnivores.},

  abstract = {Tanged points have long been considered an important proxy for cultural variability during the Incipient Jomon period of Japan. Historically, interpretations of cultural variability based on tanged points have relied entirely on studies of tang morphology. However, little attention has been paid to technological variation, which is a stronger indicator of culturally learned behavior than are morphological typologies. This paper describes ongoing research of flake scar orientation on tanged points produced by the oblique parallel pressure flaking (OPPF) technique from the Incipient Jomon. The results indicate that there is a highly significant, geographically patterned technological variation of such points. OPPF points from the south of Japan are exclusively flaked from the upper right to the lower left (URLL), while points from the north are almost always flaked from the upper left to the lower right (ULLR). Experimental research by the author and others suggests that this variation may indicate the adoption of different pressure flaking techniques in these two regions. If one considers the diversity of the flake scar patterns as an indicator of isochrestic variation in the Incipient Jomon period, the people of both regions appear to have had different culturally conditioned techniques of pressure flaking. This suggests that they did not adopt the same traditional rules concerning pressure flaking, nor did they have identical cultural behavior.},

Five of the six datasets extend back to the nineteenth century. We perform statistical analyses and show that in all six cases one can reject the exponential hypothesis at statistically significant levels. In contrast, one cannot reject the hypothesis of superexponential growth with decreasing doubling times. This raises questions about whether past trends in the improvement of information technology are sustainable.},

Flake-based blank production, an abundance of prepared and ch\^apeau de gendarme platforms, a significantly high value for the Levallois index, the presence of tools typical of `Mousterian' technology, and the near-total absence of Upper Paleolithic diagnostics all indicate that Mirak dates to the Middle Paleolithic (ca. 250e47 ka BP in the Levant). Although clearly a palimpsest, a case is made for high compositional integrity at Mirak, and a relative lack of disturbance. Second, this paper proposes three major migratory corridors used by foragers during the Upper Pleistocene and early Holocene. Identification of those corridors is based on survey data acquired since the mid-1990s, the distribution of other known Paleolithic sites on the Iranian Plateau, and sparse data from geography, geology, and geomorphology.

First, from the beginning of the twenty century to the 1980 when numerous field missions were executed in this region all by western institutes, second phase observes a twenty years gap in the Paleolithic studies hence; only few surveys could be performed in this period, and the third phase starts with the reopening of the Iranian fields to the non-Iranian researchers, which led to the survey and excavation of handful of new Paleolithic sites.

  abstract = {Understanding why females of some mammalian species cease ovulation prior to the end of life is a long-standing interdisciplinary and evolutionary challenge. In humans and some species of toothed whales, females can live for decades after stopping reproduction. This unusual life history trait is thought to have evolved, in part, due to the inclusive fitness benefits that postreproductive females gain by helping kin. In humans, grandmothers gain inclusive fitness benefits by increasing their number of surviving grandoffspring, referred to as the grandmother effect. Among toothed whales, the grandmother effect has not been rigorously tested. Here, we test for the grandmother effect in killer whales, by quantifying grandoffspring survival with living or recently deceased reproductive and postreproductive grandmothers, and show that postreproductive grandmothers provide significant survival benefits to their grandoffspring above that provided by reproductive grandmothers. This provides evidence of the grandmother effect in a nonhuman menopausal species. By stopping reproduction, grandmothers avoid reproductive conflict with their daughters, and offer increased benefits to their grandoffspring. The benefits postreproductive grandmothers provide to their grandoffspring are shown to be most important in difficult times where the salmon abundance is low to moderate. The postreproductive grandmother effect we report, together with the known costs of late-life reproduction in killer whales, can help explain the long postreproductive life spans of resident killer whales.},

  abstract = {This chapter explores patterns of knowing and learning, among Nayaka hunter-gatherers (South India). I will argue that knowing and learning is embedded within two main contexts. One is personal experimentation, which often involves processes of trial and error. The second context is engagement with others in which learning is not a singularized event and knowledge is not objectified out of actual experience and actual relations. In both contexts, learning is characterized by firsthand experience, which includes adults' appreciation of the need; children have to learn for themselves through direct experience. The chapter draws special attention to the importance of the epistemological aspect in social learning, the use of questions and patterns of classification among the Nayaka and other hunter-gatherer groups.},

  abstract = {Due to its significant position between the Sahara Desert and tropical Africa, Senegal may have played a decisive role in the dispersal of modern humans between North and sub-Saharan Africa. However, our knowledge about these intra-African dispersals and the character of the demographic connection between North and sub-Saharan Africa are poorly understood and archaeological records in the Sahel are limited. Between 1940 and 1960, the Senegalese littoral yielded prehistoric sites attributed to the Middle Stone Age (MSA) or Middle Palaeolithic. This chrono-cultural framework is based on typological considerations about lithic industries generally found in secondary or disturbed stratigraphic contexts. Of these sites, Tiemassas has been considered to be the most important. Located about 100 km from Dakar, the site has been considered Middle Palaeolithic, Mesolithic and even Neolithic, but has not been analysed in detail. In this paper, the compositions of the lithic assemblages represented at Tiemassas are discussed and their technological strategies are analyzed. Results indicate that the site is characterized by the use of diverse strategies of raw material exploitation in relation to the morphology and morphometry of the exploited pebbles. The assemblage is flake dominated, generally characterized by typical MSA methods such as Levallois, opportunistic (Syst eme par Surface de D ebitage Alterne  (SSDA)) and discoid flaking, and more rarely by laminar methods. Finally, retouch is usually applied to transform objects into side-scrapers. These results are indicative of a MSA cultural attribution and represent a first step in the process of definition and description of the Senegalese MSA together with its wider continental context. \textcopyright{} 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

  abstract = {During geomorphic reconnaissance of the Lower Cunene River near the reach of Serra Cafema, a significant accumulation of Middle Stone Age artifacts was discovered along the Namibia\textendash Angolan border. The archaeological site is downstream of the Marienfluss\textendash Hartmann Valley and lies along the eastern perimeter of the hyperarid Cunene erg (sandsea). Within the study area, the Cunene River is a bedrock anabranching \textendash{} mixed bedrock-alluvial anabranching system with a morphology that is strongly controlled by lithology and structure and a hydrology dominated by tropical rainfall in the headwaters. A 5 m high alluvial terrace along the left bank of the perennial river is mantled with a surface lag of cobbles and gravels that includes MSA lithics. More than 30 artifacts are preserved in this open-air context. Finds include quartzite flakes, cores, and Levallois\textendash Mousterian points with varying degrees of edge abrasion and varnish; these appear to be the first Levallois\textendash Mousterian points found in this region of Africa. Since the archaeology of this region is poorly known, these cultural assemblages enable initial correlations across southern Africa. A replicate OSL-SAR date w220 kyr provides initial age constraints on a sand preserved within the cobble-boulder terrace fill, and constrains a maximum age for the overlying archaeological assemblage. This is the first MSA site in northern Namibia in direct stratigraphic context with a securely dated unit. The artifact assemblage underscores the importance of riparian corridors in reconstructing hominin behaviours during the Middle Pleistocene, the time frame marked by the first appearance and the dispersal of the modern human species Homo sapiens.},

  abstract = {Quantitative, well-dated, local paleoenvironmental records are necessary to 1) evaluate responses to regional to global-scale climate change at the scale of human habitats, and 2) test hypotheses regarding the effects of environmental change and human biological and cultural evolution. Ostrich eggshell (OES) fragments are common in African archaeological sequences, are amenable to 14C and 230Th/U dating, and their stable carbon (d13C values) and nitrogen (d15N values) isotopic compositions track local vegetation and mean annual precipitation (MAP), respectively. We review previous interpretations of the stable isotopic composition of OES, apply a novel calibration to estimate paleo-MAP (PMAP) from d15N values, and show that oxygen isotopes (d18O values) record evapotranspiration, which is controlled by temperature, relative humidity, and/or photosynthetic performance, if other components of the water cycle are constrained. The stable isotopic compositions of the organic fraction of OES remain unaltered to at least \textasciitilde 50 ka, indicating potential to examine even older OES. We present a \textasciitilde 50e4 ka record of OES d13C, d15N, and d18O values from archaeological sites recording the Middle to Later Stone Age (MSA/LSA) transition at Lukenya Hill (Kenya) and Kisese II (Tanzania). Stable isotope proxies indicate contrasting but subtle changes in local paleoenvironment throughout the records at both sites, likely explained by local ecological and climatological effects that are not resolved by regional-scale paleoclimate records. These records highlight the need for additional local studies to assess the covariance of paleoenvironments and material culture. Furthermore, they indicate that the MSA/LSA transition at the two sites did not result from paleoenvironmental change.},

  abstract = {The African Middle Stone Age (MSA, typical range \textasciitilde{} 320\textendash 30 ka) has been the subject of intense research interest in recent decades as a culture-chronological Unit associated with the emergence and dispersal of our species. Recent results of this work have shown that sites designated as ``MSA'' contain common approaches to lithic reduction, but that within this rubric, there is much diversity in overall assemblage characteristics and the timing of their appearance across the continent. As researchers recover more data from more sites, especially from undersampled geographic regions, this more complex picture of the MSA reveals technological and other behavioral diversity in early modern human populations that may inform about the ultimate success of our species. Here we add to this growing database by describing the environmental context and characteristics of two concentrations of stone artifacts from the late MSA (\textasciitilde{} 43\textendash 21 ka) open-air locality of Chaminade-I (CHA-I), near the town of Karonga in northern Malawi. The CHA-I lithic artifacts show a flexible approach to stone tool production and use that is common to assemblages in Karonga but distinctive from MSA sites reported elsewhere. Radial and minimally reduced cores typify an unelaborated lithic assemblage, in which raw material choice is driven by toolstone clast size and shape rather than preferential use or treatment of specific materials, as found in MSA assemblages in the East African Rift, South Africa, and the North African coast. Lithic reduction at CHA-I took place within a woody, riparian context embedded within a more open woodland landscape. Most artifacts occurred in near-channel sandy deposits dated to \textasciitilde{} 41 ka, and were buried under alluvial fan deposits that began aggrading by at least \textasciitilde{} 21 ka and continued beyond \textasciitilde{} 5.5 ka within a grassy, open landscape. The site's late MSA age and lack of elaboration in lithic technology challenges straightforward ideas of increasing complexity in human technological behavior over time and provides important insight into the diversity of MSA technologies and the environmental conditions in which they existed.},

Ant-fishing is a type of tool-using behavior that has been exhibited by Mahale chimpanzees when feeding upon arboreal carpenter ants (Camponotus spp.) since the 1970s, and is now regarded as a candidate of wild chimpanzee culture. Herein, I describe in detail the features of ant-fishing shown by the Mahale M group chimpanzees: (1) 2 species of Camponotus ants (Camponotus sp. (chrysurus-complex) [C. sp.1] and C. brutus) were identified as the target species of ant-fishing, and C. sp.1 was selected intensively as the main target; (2) 24 species (92 individuals) of trees were identified as ant-fishing sites\textendash these were widely distributed throughout the western/lowland region of the M group's home range, and the top 5 species were used more frequently; (3) the efficiency of ant-fishing was influenced not only by the site choice or the skillfulness of the chimpanzees, but inevitably by the condition of the ants; (4) the estimated nutritional intake from ant-fishing was apparently negligible; (5) most of the M group members (50/60 individuals) older than 3 years of age successfully used tools to fish for ants; and (6) female chimpanzees engaged in ant-fishing more frequently and for longer periods than males did. Further, I compared the features of ant-fishing exhibited by the Mahale M group chimpanzees with those exhibited by the former K group at Mahale and by other populations of wild chimpanzees.},

Our refined age indicates that H. cepranensis lived in central Italy probably during the cold period of marine isotope stage (MIS) 10, and that despite his archaic morphology and lack of Neanderthal traits, he was contemporaneous with more advanced species such as H. heidelbergensis.},

  abstract = {Following the stratigraphic sequence described by D. Garrod in her pioneering excavations at Tabun Cave, the Levantine Mousterian is traditionally divided into three sub-stages (B, C, D) according to changes in modal forms of Levallois production. Despite the ubiquity of this terminology, none of these three stages from Tabun has been described in detail. Furthermore, our knowledge of variability in technology and chronology within the Levantine Middle Paleolithic has increased markedly in the last three decades. This variation is especially apparent in the Early Middle Paleolithic, when both Levallois and non-Levallois laminar methods appear in most sites but with different frequencies. In this paper we provide a reconstruction of the Levallois technology in the early Middle Paleolithic of Tabun Cave using assemblages from Jelinek's excavations in Unit IX (Garrod's layer D). In contrast to many other contemporary sites, where non-Levallois laminar production is strongly represented, the assemblage of Unit IX is dominated by a recurrent, unipolar Levallois technology. Understanding the specific character of the ``prototype'' of Tabun D is an important step towards assessing inter- and intra-assemblage variability within the Levantine Early Middle Paleolithic. Appreciating this variation is in turn essential for explaining the apparently sudden appearance of these early Mousterian assemblages between 200 and 250 kya. The method used at Tabun Unit IX is both flexible and efficient, yielding both large numbers of blanks and a range of products while reducing the waste of material involved in shaping and maintaining of the core. In these assemblages, blades, flakes and Levallois points, and a variety of other products, were produced through systematic exploitation of different parts of the core's surface. In this respect the technology of Tabun Unit IX differs from the `laminar method' known from other early Levantine assemblages in the organization of production and in its economic features and the range of products.},

The decoupling of modern anatomy and modern behavior has prompted researchers to reframe studies of the emergence of modern humans as a debate that explicitly focuses on the origins of behavioral modernity making its intersection with modern anatomy a point of discussion rather than a given. Four questions arise from this debate: (a) What is modern behavior? (b) Is the emergence of modern behavior sudden or more gradual? (c) Is modern behavior unique to modern humans or more widely shared with other species, most notably the Neandertals? (d) Is the emergence of modern behavior primarily the result of new cognitive abilities or social, cultural, demographic, and historic factors? This review briefly addresses each of these questions and in the process offers some thoughts on the current state of the debate.},

Structured Abstract
BACKGROUNDTraditionally, research into contemporary economic development has taken a primarily ahistorical approach. The study of the past was relegated to the separate field of economic history, and connections between historical factors and present-day economic outcomes were seldom made. In recent decades, there has been a rapidly growing body of research within economics that takes a historical perspective when attempting to understand contemporary issues related to global poverty and comparative development.
ADVANCESTypically, studies of this kind begin by collecting new data, often from archival sources, that measure aspects of the historical episode of interest. These data are then connected to contemporary outcomes of interest, matched through populations, societies, or locations, to test whether the historical factor has a causal effect on the contemporary factors being examined. Statistical analysis is undertaken, studying variation across individuals, ethnicities, or countries and using empirical techniques (such as instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, difference-in-difference, or natural experiments) that are aimed at distinguishing causal relationships from mere correlation. Having established the importance of a historical factor or episode for outcomes today, an attempt is then made to understand the exact causal mechanisms that account for the observed relationship. This generally requires the collection of additional data and additional statistical analysis, as well as an integration of the historical literature and descriptive evidence.A body of empirical research that has emerged over the past two decades has established that a substantial proportion of the variation in economic prosperity that we observe in the world today has its roots in the past. Historical events, such as European expansion across the globe during the 16th century and after, have been shown to have shaped subsequent paths of development. It is now clear that one cannot fully understand contemporary economic development without understanding its historical roots.
OUTLOOKA common reaction to the finding that history is important for contemporary outcomes is that this leaves little room for policy. If much of the nature of the world today is determined through historical processes, what role is there for policy? I explain how such a view, while natural, is incorrect.In addition to providing a more complete understanding of the process of economic development, the findings from the literature are also important for thinking about policies that help to address issues related to global development moving forward. This is an important next step for the literature. Recent studies have begun to take on this next challenge.I illustrate this by providing examples of studies that seek to better understand the origins of mistrust in Western medicine. This mistrust, which is present all over the world, has resulted in underutilization of medical services, resulting in poorer health and higher mortality. Studies have examined the historical roots of such mistrust, showing how it is determined by poor medical practices in the past. I then discuss examples where the insights that are obtained from the historical analyses are used to improve the design, implementation, and effectiveness of policies. These examples illustrate a more general point: There are sizable gains to be realized from research that seeks to better understand how local history and context can be leveraged to inform the design of better policy. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science-sciencemag-org.ezproxy1.lib.asu.edu/content/sci/367/6485/eaaz9986/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Map showing the Age of Discovery, the historical period that fostered the origins of the vast differences in economic prosperity that we observe today.IMAGE COURTESY OF UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS LIBRARIES, UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN

  abstract = {The occupation of small islands presents particular challenges for people largely related to limited terrestrial resources and susceptibility to natural disasters. Nevertheless, the challenges and risks inherent in maintaining stable populations on small islands can be offset or overcome through the use of maritime technologies and exchange networks. The archaeology of Here Sorot Entapa rockshelter (HSE) on Kisar Island in the Wallacean Archipelago provides an unparalleled record for examining these issues in Southeast Asia. Kisar is the smallest of the Wallacean islands known to have a Pleistocene occupation record, and one of the smallest permanently inhabited today. Our results indicate that Here Sorot Entapa was first occupied in the terminal Pleistocene by people with advanced maritime technology who made extensive use of local marine resources and engaged in social connections with other islands through an obsidian exchange network. As a result, populations appear to have been maintained on the island for approximately 6,000 years. In the early Holocene occupation at HSE ceased for unknown reasons, and the site was not reoccupied until the mid-Holocene, during which time a major change in the lithic resources can be observed and the exchange network appears to have ceased.},

provide only slight evidence for occupation following first settlement in the late Pleistocene. Analysis of the radiocarbon
dates indicates that following this there was a hiatus in occupation during the Last Glacial Maximum. In common
with most Australian sites, the evidence for occupation increases sharply from the mid-Holocene. Faunal remains,
interpreted predominantly as the remains of people's meals, all suggest foraging of the immediate surroundings
throughout the entire period of occupation. Fragments of baler shell and scaphopod beads are present from the early
Holocene, suggesting movement of high value goods from the coast (over 200 km distant). Flakes from edge-ground
axes recovered from occupation units dated to approximately 33,000 cal. BP, when overall artefact numbers are low,
suggest that these tools formed an important component of the lithic repertoire at this time.},

While this research has extended the known antiquity of occupation in Timor and addressed questions arising from Glover's (1986) seminal work in the 1960s (O'Connor et al. 2002; Spriggs et al 2003), results of analysis have also forced further questions, particularly regarding the coherence and homogeneity of the Island Southeast Asian Neolithic `complex'; a collection of material items and cultural traits, prime amongst which is pottery, usually argued to accompany the dispersal of Austronesian-speaking agriculturalists and to mark their expansion into Island Southeast Asia. While the diffusionist view of a Neolithic cultural transformation accompanying the appearance of pottery has been challenged as an adequate explanatory mechanism for the inception of the Lapita culture in Island Melanesia (eg. Allen 1996, 2000; Allen and Gosden 1996; Green 1991, Terrell 2003), it has generally been accepted rather quietly in Island Southeast Asia. As the corpus of well dated sites within this region expands, the Island Southeast Asian `Neolithic' complex has been shown to be a chimera; too fragmentary and diverse to be regarded as a cultural entity, too simplistic to explain the diversity and complexity seen in local and regional Holocene records.},

Many researchers have suggested its origins lie in the African Middle Stone Age or the European Middle Palaeolithic ( 300-30 thousand years ago), but the perishable components of armatures rarely preserve. Most research on this subject therefore emphasises analysis of armature tip size, shape, and diagnostic impacts or residues. Other lines of evidence have included human skeletal anatomy or analyses of the species composition of faunal assemblages. Projectile Impact Marks (PIMs) on archaeofaunal remains offer an ideal complement to this work, but their potential has been restricted mainly to the later Eurasian zooarchaeological record. A review of current evidence and approaches shows that systematic PIM research could add much to our understanding of early projectile technology, especially in Africa.},

  abstract = {Assessing population trends and their underlying factors is critical to propose efficient conservation actions. This assessment can be particularly challenging when dealing with highly mobile, shy and nocturnal animals such as flying-foxes. Here we investigated the dynamics of hunted populations of Pteropus ornatus and P. tonganus in the Northern Province of New Caledonia. First, an ethno-ecological survey involving 219 local experts identified 494 flying-fox roosts. Current status was assessed for 379 of them, among which 125 were no longer occupied, representing a loss of 33\% over ca. 40 years. Second, species-specific counts conducted at 35 roosts, and a sample of animals killed by hunters, revealed that the endemic species, P. ornatus, was dominant (68.5\%). Between 2010 and 2016, 30 roosts were counted annually during the pre-parturition period. Roosts size averaged 1,425 {$\pm$} 2,151 individuals (N = 180 counts) and showed high among-year variations (roost-specific CV = 37\textendash 162\%). If we recorded significant inter-annual variation, we did not detect a significant decline over the 7-yr period, although one roost went possibly extinct. Population size of the two species combined was estimated at 338,000-859,000 individuals distributed over ca. 400 roosts in the Northern Province. Flying-foxes are popular game species and constitute traditional food for all communities of New Caledonia. Annual bags derived from a food survey allowed us to estimate harvesting rates at 5\textendash 14\%. Such a level of harvesting for species with a `slow' demography, the occurrence of poaching and illegal trade, suggest the current species use might not be sustainable and further investigations are critically needed.},

Quantitative analysis was conducted using SPSS statistical package, and the results are presented in figures and tables. The analysis was based on a qualitative definition of variables describing the archeological artifacts. The analysis shows that the catalogue of artifacts is mainly systematic, but the results also reveal non-uniformity in cataloguing. In the free description column, several categorizations were found that could be used in developing the structure of an archeological catalogue. Traditional cataloguing methods are still practiced in archeology, but these do not fulfill requirements of the future use of data. In this case, a vocabulary and a tool for cataloguing archeological artifacts would contribute to the development of cataloguing and future access of data. These devices should be flexible and support uniqueness of the artifacts. There exist tools and vocabularies for archeological cataloguing and these could be localized to fulfill the needs for the future digitalization of archeological data.},

Garivaldino presents a range of dates from 11,660 to 7540 cal BP. Multivariate statistics applied to both traditional and geometric morphometric analyses failed to reveal any important changes in shape through time. However, the coefficients of variation presented a significant increase through time in three measurements related to projectile point neck and stem. The absence of change in shape might be related to small group size and low level of cultural innovation. Such cultural stability might be related to novelty-avoiding mechanisms or the operation of a meta-tradition that would be selected in very stable environments. On the other hand, the increase in the variation of linear measurements through time might suggest an increase in population size and copying errors.},

  abstract = {Avian diversification has been influenced by global climate change, plate tectonic movements, and mass extinction events. However, the impact of these factors on the diversification of the hyperdiverse perching birds (passerines) is unclear because family level relationships are unresolved and the timing of splitting events among lineages is uncertain. We analyzed DNA data from 4,060 nuclear loci and 137 passerine families using concatenation and coalescent approaches to infer a comprehensive phylogenetic hypothesis that clarifies relationships among all passerine families. Then, we calibrated this phylogeny using 13 fossils to examine the effects of different events in Earth history on the timing and rate of passerine diversification. Our analyses reconcile passerine diversification with the fossil and geological records; suggest that passerines originated on the Australian landmass {$\sim$}47 Ma; and show that subsequent dispersal and diversification of passerines was affected by a number of climatological and geological events, such as Oligocene glaciation and inundation of the New Zealand landmass. Although passerine diversification rates fluctuated throughout the Cenozoic, we find no link between the rate of passerine diversification and Cenozoic global temperature, and our analyses show that the increases in passerine diversification rate we observe are disconnected from the colonization of new continents. Taken together, these results suggest more complex mechanisms than temperature change or ecological opportunity have controlled macroscale patterns of passerine speciation.},

I then examine examples of Inuit adults' teasing of children to understand the characteristics of teasing. Next, I situate their teasing in a sociocultural background, demonstrating that teasing functions as a device for pre-learning, which is the basis for observational learning and creative invention. Finally, using the findings of these analyses, I propose that the most important differentiating factor in learning ability between Neanderthals and modern humans is not in biological ability but in sociality, i.e., the way to collectively generate and actively be involved in sociocultural institutions.},

  abstract = {During the Late Pleistocene, anatomically modern humans (AMH) dispersed out of Africa. They first spread north with game, across the Sahara to the Levant during the Eemian interglacial (c.125~ka); and there is some recent evidence they may also have spread via Arabia to the Far East at the same time. However, they failed to continue to Europe, then occupied by Neanderthals. The Sahara and Arabia then reverted to aridity, and AMH vanished from the fossil record after 92~ka, being later replaced in the Levant, again by Neanderthals. There is recent fragmentary evidence AMH may also have spread via Arabia to the Far East, but the archaeological record fades similarly, long before the Toba eruption. There is no evidence of surviving non-African DNA lineages, dating from anywhere near the Eemian, to contradict this narrative. Genetic evidence indicates that AMH successfully left Africa much later, as a single group, by the southern route to India. Since all non-African uniparental lineages date to this later exit, this appears to have been the only ultimately successful AMH exit. AMH reached the isolated Sahul continent at least by 48~ka and possibly by 60\textendash 50~ka. AMH only finally arrived in Europe from South Asia before 46~ka, probably linked to climatic amelioration during MIS-3. Dating the definitive exit without adequate fossil evidence relies on disputed genetic dates with wide confidence intervals. At the top end, independent genetic dates combined with ash-associated data from Malaysia and from India argue for a pre-Toba exit, although the consensus view is still largely post-Toba. Recent correction for non-linearity due to purifying selection and recalibration of the mtDNA clock has improved confidence in genetic dating, but reduced the age of the main exit lineage (L3, which effectively embodies its maximum estimate) to just below that of Toba (71.6~ka), although relevant 95\% Confidence Intervals (CI: 57.1\textendash 86.6~ka) still include the Toba event. This weakening of the genetic argument puts more pressure on the archaeological evidence associated with Toba ash and the need for diagnostic, well-dated fossil data between 90\textendash 70~ka.},

  abstract = {Different authors have used different methods and nomenclatures to describe bird nests of the Neotropical region, leading to muddled terminology which makes comparisons among published data difficult. The present study suggests a standardization and a hierarchy of criteria which make easier to understand nest structures and allow direct comparisons among data from different authors in reports on bird evolution, conservation, phylogeny, etc. For that, the nest has been defined as any place where the eggs are laid. Four elementary nest standards are proposed: simple (when eggs rest on an unlined or roughly lined floor), cup (any basket or bowl-like form), closed (when the walls completely cover the incubatory chamber), and cavity (when they are placed inside natural or artificial cavities). The simple standard has two variants: unlined and platform. The cup standard has two variants: high cup and low cup; the closed standard has six variants: long, globular, furnace, irregular, ovoid and retort. The cavity standard presents simple, cup, or closed nests inside, each one with or without an access tunnel to its interior. When hierarchically ordered, these four elementary standards, their variants and the four main ways by which nests are attached to substrate (by their bases, by their laterals, by a branch fork, or pensile) proved to be efficient for the description of neotropical nests, as shown by the examples given in the text including 97 species, 88 genera, and 33 families from more than 9 countries. These combinations, totaling 30 basic nest types, allow easy evaluation of important inter- and intra-specific differences and of the evolutionary processes which are relevant to taxonomy and conservation. In addition, suggestions for making and keeping scientific nest collections are presented.},

Renfrew's down-the-line model, which results in a very regular and clustered network, does not permit the circulation of obsidian to regions of the Near East that are further than 300 km from the source zones, as is shown in the archaeological data available. Obsidian exchange is a complex system where multiple factors interact and evolve in time and space. We therefore explore AgentBased Modelling (ABM) so as to get a better understanding of complex networks. ABM simulations of an exchange network where some agents (villages) are allowed to attain long-distance exchange partners through correlated random walks are carried out. These simulations show what variables (population density, degree of collaboration between villages\ldots ) are relevant for the transfer of obsidian over long distances. Moreover, they show that a type of small-world exchange network could explain the breadth of obsidian distribution (up to 800 km from source) during the Near Eastern Neolithic.},

This is especially important for understanding the role of cities in the history of human civilization and for determining whether studies of ancient cities are relevant for contemporary science and policy. As a step in this direction, we develop a theory of settlement scaling in archaeology, deriving the relationship between population and settled area from a consideration of the interplay between social and infrastructural networks. We then test these models on settlement data from the Pre-Hispanic Basin of Mexico to show that this ancient settlement system displays spatial scaling properties analogous to those observed in modern cities. Our data derive from over 1,500 settlements occupied over two millennia and spanning four major cultural periods characterized by different levels of agricultural productivity, political centralization and market development. We show that, in agreement with theory, total settlement area increases with population size, on average, according to a scale invariant relation with an exponent in the range 2=3{$f$}a{$f$}5=6. As a consequence, we are able to infer aggregate socioeconomic properties of ancient societies from archaeological measures of settlement organization. Our findings, from an urban settlement system that evolved independently from its old-world counterparts, suggest that principles of settlement organization are very general and may apply to the entire range of human history.},

More recently, in a more sober tone, Eric Wolf suggested that the field of anthropology is coming apart. The sub-fields (and sub-sub-fields) are increasingly pursuing their specialized interests, losing contact with each other and with the whole.

The Elands Bay assemblages are grouped according to their age and features, and the primary characteristics of each period are outlined. In this way the full lithic sequence for the area is described, with emphasis being placed on the transitional assemblages and the sequence of changes in raw materials, flaking techniques and formal tools that occur through time. Gross industrial change is gradual and boundaries between industries cannot readily be identified. A relatively more distinct change just after 1000 b.p. supports the assertion that herders may have populated the Cape only from about that time onwards. A new radiocarbon date from Dunefield Midden 11 provides the earliest evidence for the occurrence of pottery in the Elands Bay area at about 1780 b.p. (AD 329).},

In this context, the role of the Andean highlands ( 3400 meters above sea level) has been neglected, because of the supposedly harsh conditions for humans including hypoxia and cold climate. Nevertheless, the environmental and cultural resources available in the high Andes constitutes an important ``megapatch'' that should be assessed in terms of human settlement patterns. We review the evidence for late Pleistocene/early Holocene hunter-gatherer occupation of one part of this megapatch, the northern Chilean Dry Puna, in its palaeoecological context. We focus on lithic technology, faunal remains, radiocarbon dates, and other archaeological materials related to different social activities, which allow us to suggest that groups of hunter-gatherers organized and adapted their way of life to highland ecosystems through logistical mobility, and curatorial strategies for lithic tool kits that included projectile points and other formalized tools. The morphology and technological processes involved are recognized over vast territories along the high Andes. We identify this material expression as the high south central Andean Archaic hunter-gatherer tradition, which also featured long distance mobile settlement systems and communication processes over this broad and distinct megapatch. More speculatively, we outline the hypothesis that these highland ecosystems constituted a suitable migratory route that may have been key for the early peopling of the continent, and contrast it with the alternative hypothesis of the initially secondary and seasonally intermittent exploitation of this habitat by hunter-gatherers dispersing along the Pacific coastal corridor.},

Multiple forms of exchange co-exist in ancient societies including market exchange and social exchange such as gift-giving. A further complicating factor is that different exchange systems such as redistribution and central place market exchange can result in the same regional spatial patterning of artifacts. Recent innovations in identifying exchange systems use network expectations for spatial, contextual, and distributional information to help distinguish between social exchanges such as gift-giving versus market exchange using household inventories. I introduce a Monte Carlo computer simulation to evaluate network expectations for alternative exchange mechanisms, using a case study of decorated ceramics from 65 residential inventories from the center of Sauce and its hinterland during the Middle Postclassic period (1200\textendash 1350 A.D.) in southcentral Veracruz, Mexico. Using these new tools, I identify the coexistence of several exchange systems operating simultaneously. The methods developed here demonstrate the potential of using network expectations to refine existing methods to identify different exchange systems that can be applied to other complex ancient economies.},

In a similarity network, archaeological contexts with similar attributes are connected according to a predefined criterion, and the edges are interpreted as potential social or causal links. Here we allow any kind of similarity relation between brick contexts as a criterion for connection, where different kinds of attributes can be mixed. The analysis suggests that there was indeed a diffusion process, as opposed to random, independent appearances of fired bricks. This diffusion seems to have taken place in a small-world social network of builders and decision-makers, where the range of most connections was shorter than 250 km but where long-range connections were also present. The data seemingly exclude a scale-free network, in which the diffusion is governed by a few dominant hubs. An early cluster of homogeneous brick usage appears in the south-eastern part of Hellenistic Europe, as well as a late cluster in the north-west. In the late cluster, the homogenisation applies to larger constructions (public or military) than in the early cluster (mainly sepulchral), suggesting that the use of fired bricks became established at higher societal levels in the last century BCE.},

  abstract = {Network theory can be employed in two ways in archaeology: it can be used to analyse archaeological data, or it can be used to model a historical process for the purpose of simulating the data. This paper focuses on the first approach. In such analyses, similar archaeological contexts are often connected to form a similarity network. Similarity is treated as a proxy for social or causal relationships. Most often, similarity is defined by the presence of the same kind of find in two contexts. However, to detect relationships effectively, we have to allow any kind of similarity relation to be a criterion for connection, in which different kinds of attributes that characterise the contexts may be mixed. We discuss how such general similarity networks can be used to disclose relational patterns hidden in archaeological data. Statistical tests are necessary to distinguish significant patterns from random patterns. We argue that random permutation tests are well suited for this task, and we introduce appropriate tests of this kind. The methods outlined are compared to other kinds of quantitative data analysis, such as correspondence analysis. We discuss which approach is more suitable for which kind of data. The choice of approach also depends on the questions addressed to the archaeological material.},

The first briefly reviews the theoretical predictions of currently accepted rational choice theory related to social dilemmas. The second section summarizes the challenges to the sole reliance on a complete model of rationality presented by extensive experimental research. In the third section, I discuss two major empirical findings that begin to show how individuals achieve results that are ``better than rational'' by building conditions where reciprocity, reputation, and trust can help to overcome the strong temptations of short-run self-interest. The fourth section raises the possibility of developing second-generation models of rationality, the fifth section develops an initial theoretical scenario, and the final section concludes by examining the implications of placing reciprocity, reputation, and trust at the core of an empirically tested, behavioral theory of collective action.},

These types are evaluated in terms of their comparative complexity and are placed in one of 10 technical spheres denoting the primary purpose of an artifact. From these data it is established that technounit comparisons are a more sensitive indicator of technological complexity than are type summaries. It also is clear that generalizations about the complexity of "Eskimo material culture" arev open to question since the Tareumiut had 619 more technounits than did the Polar Eskimos. Conventional wisdom holds that Eskimo foodgetting technology was the most complex aspect, yet in this analysis clothing and shelter forms proved to be more complex. Further, the study shows that Polar Eskimo food-getting forms became less complex as these people adapted to their particular habitat. Finally, and contrary to what might be expected, it appears that tool kit complexity is not a good indicator of nontool complexity for these Eskimos.},

  abstract = {Hypothesis tests based on linear models are widely accepted by organizations that regulate clinical trials. These tests are derived using strong assumptions about the data-generating process so that the resulting inference can be based on parametric distributions. Because these methods are well understood and robust, they are sometimes applied to data that depart from assumptions, such as ordinal integer scores. Permutation tests are a nonparametric alternative that require minimal assumptions which are often guaranteed by the randomization that was conducted. We compare analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), a special case of linear regression that incorporates stratification, to several permutation tests based on linear models that control for pretreatment covariates. In simulations of randomized experiments using models which violate some of the parametric regression assumptions, the permutation tests maintain power comparable to ANCOVA. We illustrate the use of these permutation tests alongside ANCOVA using data from a clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of two treatments for gastroesophageal reflux disease. Given the considerable costs and scientific importance of clinical trials, an additional nonparametric method, such as a linear model permutation test, may serve as a robustness check on the statistical inference for the main study endpoints.},

  abstract = {Rehydroxylation (RHX) dating was recently suggested as a simple, cheap, and accurate method for dating ceramics. It depends on the constant rate of rehydroxylation (the slow reintroduction of OH) of clays after they are fired and dehydroxylated (purged of OH) during the production of pots, bricks, or other ceramics. The original firing of the ceramic artifact should set the dating clock to zero by driving all hydroxyls out of the clay chemical structure. To examine whether this assumption holds, especially for pot firings of short duration and low intensity, as those in small-scale traditional settings, we performed thermogravimetric analysis of clay samples of known mineralogy at temperatures and for durations reported from traditional sub-Saharan, American, and South Asian pottery firings. Results demonstrate that in the majority of samples, complete dehydroxylation (DHX) did not occur within, or even beyond, the conditions common in traditional firings. Consequently, between 0.01 and 1.5\% of a sample's mass in residual OH may remain after firings analogous to those observed in the ethnographic record. Lack of complete DHX at the scales we have observed can result in the over-estimation of ceramic ages by decades to tens of thousands of years, depending largely on the age of the sample, and the amount of residual OH present. Thus, in many cases, a key assumption underlying current RHX dating methods is unlikely to have been met, introducing considerable error in dates.},

In this paper, we provide a critical review of the extant linguistic and molecular anthropological data on Africa and discuss the insights they provide concerning the expansion itself as well as the demographic processes involved in it. Contrary to some assumptions by historians and cultural anthropologists, the genetic data speak in favor of an actual movement of peoples during the expansion of the Bantu languages over Africa, rather than a spread through language and culture shift. Furthermore, the molecular data indicate that sociocultural practices such as patrilocality and possibly even polygyny played a role in shaping the genetic diversity of Bantu-speaking peoples. These sociocultural practices might explain why, in Africa, there is a correlation between Y-chromosomal (i.e., paternal) lineages and linguistic affiliation, but not between mtDNA (maternal) lineages and language.},

  abstract = {Clarifying the mechanisms that determine diversity in communities is a key task in biodiversity conservation. Niche differentiation, dispersal limitation, and stochastic processes are possible causes of variation in community composition, or beta diversity. In this study we quantified variation in ant assemblages related to environmental and spatial factors. We used pitfall traps to sample ant assemblages across a ca. 1200 km transect through arid and semi-arid heterogeneous environments of Iran. We then applied these data to canonical analysis to disentangle the relative importance of environmental and spatial processes. A total of 69 species / morphospecies were collected along the North-South transect. Cataglyphis was the most speciose genus with 12 species, followed by Messor and Monomorium with ten and seven species, respectively. Our parsimonious environmental and spatial models jointly explained 62\% of the variation in community composition of ants. Community composition was primarily controlled by environmental factors (45\%). Variation in ant species composition was driven by the amount of precipitation and also by its occurrence patterns. A large number of species were highly localized to a certain habitat. The overall findings suggest that mechanisms linked to environmental filtering and niche-based processes may be regulating beta diversity on ants in the Persian semi-deserts and deserts. Environmental factors appear also to control ant dispersal. Future conservation studies on insects should carefully take the temporal pattern of precipitation into account.},

The Marquesas, located at the eastern-most fringes of the Austronesian expansion, offer a unique opportunity to examine the effects of a protracted population expansion wave on population structure. We explore the contribution of Melanesian, Asian and European heritage to the Marquesan islands of Nuku-Hiva, Hiva-Oa and Tahuata. Overall, the Marquesas Islands are genetically homogeneous. In the Marquesan Archipelago all of the mtDNA haplogroups are of Austronesian origin belonging to the B4a1 subhaplogroup as the region marks the end of a west to east decreasing cline of Melanesian mtDNA starting with the West Polynesian population of Tonga. Genetic discrepancies are less pronounced between the Marquesan and Society islands, and among the Marquesan islands. Interestingly, a number of Melanesian, Polynesian and European Y-chromosome haplogroups exhibit very different distribution between the Marquesan islands of Nuku Hiva and Hiva Oa, likely resulting from drift, differential migration involving various source populations and/or unique trading routes.},

The region under investigation in Semnan Province is located in the northwestern margins of Dasht-e Kavir in Iranian Plateau. It was investigated primarily in 1980s and 1990s by Iranian archaeologists. From 2009, The Paleolithic Survey of the Iranian Central Desert Project (PSICDP) was established in order to evaluate the Paleolithic potential of the region, as a result of which Palaeolithic sites were documented and their surface collections were published. The current survey was conducted as a part of PSICDP project in autumn 2017. As a result, 12 caves and rock shelters were recorded, despite the promising condition of which only one had evidence from Palaeolithic Period. Anzo Cave, in northwest of Mehdishahr, was the only cave which yielded few number of chipped stones on the outer slope of the cave. The results of this survey raise the possibility that movement patterns of Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers in the region included seasonal-vertical movements between mountainous area in the north and southern lowlands. Recent discovery of Anzo Cave re-emphasizes the significance of the region as a part of migratory pathways during the Pleistocene.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, children in the Jarawa community (South and Middle Andamans) play games that replicate the movements of animals their parents hunt in the forest. Jarawa children and adolescents grow up observing adults' activities and incorporating them into their play. Boys often replicate the hunting practices of adults by making replicas of the bow and arrow. Jarawa adults view children as complete individuals and assume that children will, of their own accord, begin contributing to the political economy of the band when they are ready to do so. This also implies that children learn on their own not just finite skills but through play learn to negotiate diverse situations in their changing world. Since 1999 the world of the Jarawas has undergone a rapid transformation. The outward hostility and self-imposed isolation of the Jarawa community have eroded, and the young boys have begun hanging out at the major road passing through the reserve forest. This paper considers changes that have occurred in Jarawa children's play since 2001 with the influence of traffic, tourists, and a more visible state authority. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork, this chapter illustrates various aspects of children's play: the different ways in which play facilitates the articulation and maintenance of, as well as challenges to, power relations between the Jarawa and elements of encroaching modernity. In this sense, play is revealed to be far from just ``hanging out at the roadside'' but an activity through which children develop and learn to conduct new politico-economic relations in a place where outsiders, state, forest, and Jarawas collide. Open image in new window Jarawa children play at the Andaman Trunk Road (ATR) (1999) imitating fiddler crabs to while away the time before the next convoy of traffic passes by and is attracted to stop and watch the kids at the roadside, while the adults wait on the side to contact and gather from the road users},

  abstract = {Estimating Acheulian group sizes based on a fragmentary archaeological record is fraught with difficulties, more so in regions like India, where lithics form the primary source of information. Here, we review current approaches towards modeling group size in Indian archaeology. We then examine to what extent one may address issues related to seasonality, fission-fusion strategies and group size in the context of Acheulian sites, drawing on our research along the southeastern coast of India. We move between multiple scales of analysis: from the regional Acheulian archaeological record to specific studies at the site of Attirampakkam (ATM). We consider aspects of site distribution, sizes, artefact densities and Acheulian lithic reduction strategies, factoring in issues related to geomorphology, taphonomy and chronology. Acheulian hominins occupied the study region over the early to middle Pleistocene, and the fragmented lithic reduction sequence noted on landscape scales suggests diverse site functions structured by ease of access to quartzite raw material for large flake production in addition to other resources. In contrast to most sites, the absence of raw material at ATM necessitated groups to anticipate this, and organize their behavior on landscape scales, and on-site, to resolve this issue. We show how successive groups were attracted to the site over the early Pleistocene, potentially aiming at exploiting seasonally predictable biological resources in a riparian environment, knowledge of which was transmitted across generations. Considerations of the spatial and temporal variability in artefact densities across a vast site area, along with aspects of the lithic reduction sequences suggests a short-duration occupation by a potentially large group, possibly resulting from aggregation of several small groups as noted in some ethnographic examples of hunter-gatherer fission-fusion strategies. We show drastic changes in behavioral organization in the succeeding Middle Palaeolithic phases at the site and in the region.},

The experiments provide clear quantifiable guidelines for identifying bipolar reduction in archeological assemblages. They suggest that with bipolar reduction\textemdash a straightforward and time-efficient strategy to learn\textemdash toolmakers could easily surpass the cutting edge/mass efficiency levels of more derived lithic reduction strategies such as pressure blade production. Here we compared the efficiency and technological attributes on the experiment's milky quartz and flint flakes. The results show few practically significant differences between the two flake samples. The strongest differences are in the flakes' ventral surface and platform features. Otherwise, we concur with previous experimental studies that show certain types of milky quartz behave in essentially the same way as other brittle materials such as flint. Our results aid the identification of bipolar reduction with a focus on cores and flakes. They contribute to a growing body of literature showing the importance of simple, but not simplistic, technological strategies in prehistoric human decision-making.},

  abstract = {Stone tools provide some of the best remaining evidence of behavioral change over long periods, but their cognitive and evolutionary implications remain poorly understood. Here, we contribute to a growing body of experimental research on the cognitive and perceptual-motor foundations of stone toolmaking skills by using a flake prediction paradigm to assess the relative importance of technological understanding vs. accurate action execution in Late Acheulean\textendash style handaxe production. This experiment took place as part of a larger, longitudinal study of knapping skill acquisition, allowing us to assemble a large sample of predictions across learning stages and in a comparative sample of experts. By combining group and individual-level statistical analyses with predictive modeling, we show that understanding and predicting specific flaking outcomes in this technology is both more difficult and less important than expected from previous work. Instead, our findings reveal the critical importance of perceptual motor skills needed to manage speed-accuracy trade-offs and reliably detach the large, invasive flakes that enable bifacial edging and thinning. With practice, novices increased striking accuracy, flaking success rates, and (to an extent) handaxe quality by targeting small flakes with acute platform angles. However, only experts were able to combine percussive force and accuracy to produce results comparable with actual Late Acheulean handaxes. The relatively intense demands for accurate action execution documented in our study indicate that biomechanical properties of the upper limb, cortical and cerebellar systems for sensorimotor control, and the cognitive, communicative, and affective traits supporting deliberate practice would all have been likely targets of selection acting on Late Acheulean toolmaking aptitude.},

  abstract = {Lithic miniaturization refers to the systematic production and use of small tools made from small cores. Archaeologists typically associate the production of miniature toolkits with small retouched tools or `microliths'. Yet, ethnographic accounts and archaeological data show that miniature toolkits also comprised small unretouched flakes and bladelets. Because it proliferates during the Late Pleistocene and is associated with the Later Stone Age in Africa, archaeologists associate lithic miniaturization with `modern human behavior'. However, toolkit miniaturization is no more consistent a feature of Late Pleistocene assemblages than bone point production, rock art, or engraved ochre. Lithic miniaturization was one of many strategic options our Pleistocene ancestors employed. The paper reports a miniaturized lithic assemblage marked by the systematic production of small unretouched flakes and bladelets from small cores (b 5 g) during the Late Pleistocene (c. 14\textendash 12 ka calBP) at Ntloana T\v{s}oana rock shelter in Lesotho. This assemblage was made on a range of locally available rock types using freehand and bipolar reduction. Analogous lithic assemblages are reported from elsewhere in southern Africa suggesting that unretouched miniaturized toolkits were widespread. The process of systematic unretouched small tool production could be ancient, but the extent of these processes remain unknown. Using appropriate terminology combined with contextual approaches to defining and quantifying lithic miniaturization while demonstrating the intent to miniaturize toolkits provide initial solutions to this problem.},

  abstract = {Despite its theoretical importance, the process of stone tool-making skill acquisition remains understudied and poorly understood. The challenges and costs of skill learning constitute an oft-neglected factor in the evaluation of alternative adaptive strategies and a potential source of bias in cultural transmission. Similarly, theory and data indicate that the most salient neural and cognitive demands of stone tool-making should occur during learning rather than expert performance. Unfortunately, the behavioral complexity and extensive learning requirements that make stone knapping skill acquisition an interesting object of study are the very features that make it so challenging to investigate experimentally. Here we present results from a multidisciplinary study of Late Acheulean handaxe-making skill acquisition involving twenty-six na\"ive participants and up to 90 hours training over several months, accompanied by a battery of psychometric, behavioral, and neuroimaging assessments. In this initial report, we derive a robust quantitative skill metric for the experimental handaxes using machine learning algorithms, reconstruct a group-level learning curve, and explore sources of individual variation in learning outcomes. Results identify particular cognitive targets of selection on the efficiency or reliability of tool-making skill acquisition, quantify learning costs, highlight the likely importance of social support, motivation, persistence, and self-control in knapping skill acquisition, and illustrate methods for reliably reconstructing ancient learning processes from archaeological evidence.},

  abstract = {Due to decreasing resource densities, higher latitude hunteregatherers need to maintain their social networks over greater geographic distances than their equatorial counterparts. This suggests that as latitude increases, the frequency of face-to-face interaction decreases for `weak tie' relationships in the outer mating pool (\textasciitilde 500-strong) and tribal (\textasciitilde 1500-strong) layers of a hunter-gatherer social network. A key question, then, is how a hunter-gatherer tribe sustains coherence as a single identifiable unit given that members are distributed across a large geographic area. The first step in answering this question is to establish whether the expectation that network maintenance raises a challenge for hunteregatherers is correct, or whether sustaining inter-group contact is in fact trivial. Here I present a null model that represents mobile groups as randomly and independently moving gas particles. The aim of this model is to examine whether face-to-face contact can be maintained with every member of an individual's tribe at all latitudes even under the baseline assumption of random movement. Contrary to baseline expectations, the number of encounters between groups predicted by the gas model cannot support tribal cohesion and is significantly negatively associated with absolute latitude. In addition, above \textasciitilde 40  latitude random mobility no longer produces a sufficient number of encounters between groups to maintain contact across the 500-strong mating pool. These model predictions suggest that the outermost layers of hunteregatherers' social networks may require additional mechanisms of support in the form of strategies that either enhance encounter rates, such as coordinated mobility patterns, or lessen the need for face-to-face interaction, such as the use of symbolic artefacts to represent social affiliations. Given the predicted decline in encounters away from the equator, such additional supports might be most strongly expressed at high latitudes.},

  abstract = {Social behaviour is notoriously difficult to study archaeologically and it is unclear how large the networks of prehistoric humans were, or how they remained connected. Maintaining social cohesion was crucial for early humans because social networks facilitate cooperation and are imperative for survival and reproduction. Recent hunter\textendash gatherer social organisation typically comprises a number of nested layers, ranging from the nuclear family through to the  1500-strong ethnolinguistic tribe. Here we compare maximum obsidian transfer distances from the late Pleistocene with ethnographic data on the size of the geographic areas associated with each of these social grouping layers in recent hunter\textendash gatherers. The closest match between the two is taken to indicate the maximum social layer within which contact could be sustained by Pleistocene hominins. Within both the (sub)tropical African and Subarctic biomes, the maximum obsidian transfer distances for Pleistocene modern humans ( 200 km and  400 km respectively) correspond to the geographic ranges of the outermost tribal layer in recent hunter\textendash gatherers. This suggests that modern humans could potentially sustain the cohesion of their entire tribe at all latitudes, even though networks are more dispersed nearer the poles. Neanderthal maximum obsidian transfer distances (300 km) indicate that although Neanderthal home ranges are larger than those of low latitude hominins, Neanderthals travelled shorter distances than modern humans living at the same high latitudes. We argue that, like modern humans, Neanderthals could have maintained tribal cohesion, but that their tribes were substantially smaller than those of contemporary modern humans living in similar environments. The greater time taken to traverse the larger modern human tribal ranges may have limited the frequency of their face-to-face interactions and thus necessitated additional mechanisms to ensure network connectivity, such as the exchange of symbolic artefacts including ornaments and figurines. Such cultural supports may not have been required to the same extent by the Neanderthals due to their smaller tribes and home ranges.},

  abstract = {Over the last several years, network methods and models from the social and physical sciences have gained considerable popularity in archaeology. Many of the most common network methods begin with the creation of binary networks where links among some set of actors are defined as either present or absent. In most archaeological cases, however, the presence or absence of a specific kind of relationship between actors is not straightforward as we must rely on material proxies for assessing connections. A common approach in recent studies has been to define some threshold for the presence of a tie by partitioning continuous relational data among sites (e.g., artifact frequency or similarity data). In this article, using an example from the U.S. Southwest, we present a sensitivity analysis focused on the potential effects of defining binary networks from continuous relational data. We show that many key network properties that are often afforded social interpretations are fundamentally influenced by the assumptions used to define connections. We suggest that, although network graphs provide powerful visualizations of network data, methods for creating and analyzing weighted (non-binarized) networks often provide a better characterization of specific network properties.},

The 12 m thick sedimentary sequence includes several layers that have yielded variable amounts of flint artefacts and faunal remains, particularly in BR11, A11, A8-A9 and A5A6, related to repeated and complex human occupations. The earliest assemblages record the exclusive use of the Levallois method from S9 to BR7 for the production of flakes with unidirectional and centripetal recurrent modalities. In BR9, bifaces and different types of cores have also been found. The first striking technological replacement occurs in BR6, up to BR3, where there is a complex of layers with the infrequent occurrence of bones, flakes and scrapers, made with a method closely resembling the Quina technique. Further evidence of variability in lithic technology is provided by the re-appearance of the Levallois technology during MIS3, in layer A11 e although here focused more on blades than flakes e and by the Levallois/Discoid alternance throughout the transect from A10V to A5-A6. The persistence of the Mousterian tradition in the lowermost A4 Uluzzian level continues to be evidenced by Levallois flakes and cores, side-scrapers, points and thinned implements. The presence of conjoined flakes and cores proves that innovations occurred in A4 and A3 and, with the disappearance of the Levallois technology in A3, other methods focused on different kinds of flakes, short thick blades, thin bladelets and flake-bladelets.},

Although the Uluzzian has been viewed as a supposed product of modern humans settling in Mediterranean Europe, the technoecultural complex has been the subject of few investigations aiming to clarify its chronology, bone industry, and settlement dynamics. Further, little is known of its technological structure. This article presents the results of an extensive study of the lithic and bone technologies from assemblages recovered at Fumane Cave in the north of Italy. Results confirm that the Uluzzian is a flake-dominated industry that brings together a set of technological innovations. The Levallois is the most used method in the initial phase, which is replaced by more varied flaking procedures and an increase in bladelets and flake-blades. Sidescrapers and points also represent a Mousterian feature in the initial phase, while splintered pieces, backed knives and other Upper Palaeolithic tools increase in the later phase. Our results suggest that the Uluzzian is rooted in the Mousterian lithic technological context and cannot be viewed as a proxy for anatomically modern humans, the carriers of the abrupt cultural changes related to the Aurignacian.},

We use a natural experiment, the colonization of Southeast Asia and Andaman Islands, to estimate the rate at which phonemic diversity increases through time. Using this rate, we estimate that present-day languages date back to the Middle Stone Age in Africa. Our analysis is consistent with the archaeological evidence suggesting that complex human behavior evolved during the Middle Stone Age in Africa, and does not support the view that language is a recent adaptation that has sparked the dispersal of humans out of Africa. While some of our assumptions require testing and our results rely at present on a single case-study, our analysis constitutes the first estimate of when language evolved that is directly based on linguistic data.},

  abstract = {Assessments of the complexity of lithic technologies coming from different time periods, regions, or hominid species
are recurrent features of the literature on Paleolithic archaeology. Yet the notion of lithic complexity is often defined
intuitively and qualitatively, which can easily lead to circular arguments and makes difficult the comparison of
assemblages across different regions and time periods. Here we propose, in the spirit of Oswalt's techno-units, that
the complexity of lithic technology can be quantified by counting the procedural units involved in tool manufacture.
We define procedural units as mutually exclusive manufacturing steps that make a distinct contribution to the
finished form of a technology. As a proof of concept, we use the procedural-unit approach to measure the complexity

lithic technological complexity increased throughout the Paleolithic period. The method to measure lithic complexity

The archaeological record is the main source of information about the pace of cultural change, but it is an imperfect one, as taphonomic loss and mixing distort rate measurements. Here, I focus on the impact of time-averaging on rate measurements. Time-averaging arises when archaeological materials associated with activities and events that took place at different points in time are mixed into the same unit, whether because of depositional processes, disturbance factors, or because archaeologists lump together archaeological contexts when creating analytical units. I use analytical models to show how time-averaging can slow down the observed rates of change under two general modes of cultural change: random drift and directional change. I test this prediction using empirical rates of change from the archaeological record of North America. I show that empirical rates of change are indeed inversely correlated with the duration of time-averaging and provide a range estimate for this correlation.},

  abstract = {Chert outcrops on eastern Santa Cruz Island were of vital importance to the inhabitants of the Santa Barbara Channel region because of their comparatively limited availablity elsewhere on the California Channel Islands. Temporally diagnostic artifacts and radiocarbon dates from associated shell middens suggest that chert quarries were exploited throughout the Holocene. The importance of these quarries has been well documented in regard to microlith production as part of the shell bead industry during the late Holocene. However, relatively little is known about local chert tool manufacture and exchange in earlier times. Systematic documentation of 26 known chert quarries, and sampling at associated shell middens on eastern Santa Cruz Island has resulted in the identification of significant spatial variability in chert exploitation through time. Whereas chert quarrying during the middle Holocene appears to have been opportunistic and dispersed throughout the landscape, comparable activities during the late Holocene became increasingly circumscribed as microlith production was intensified. These trends in chert procurement are interpreted in the context of temporal changes in subsistence, tool manufacture, and residential mobility on the northern Channel Islands, and have broad implications for spatial and temporal patterning in prehistoric lithic exploitation.

            Resumen
            Los afloramientos de silex en la parte Oeste de la Isla de Santa Cruz fueron de vital importancia para los habitantes de la regi\'on, ya que esta materia prima se encuentra relativamente ausente en el resto de las Islas del Canal de Santa B\'arbara. Artefactos diagn\'osticos y fechas de radiocarb\'on asociadas a conchales siguieren que minas de silex fueron explotadas a lo largo de todo el Holoceno. La importancia de estas fuentes de aprovisionamiento ha sido bien documentada en relaci\'on a la producci\'on de microlitos como parte de la industria de cuentas de concha durante el Holoceno Tard\'io. A pesar de esto, relativamente poco se sabe sobre la manufactura local de artefactos de silex y su intercambio en tiempos m\'as tempranos. La documentaci\'on sistem\'atica de 26 fuentes de silex, as\'i como muestreos en conchales asociados en la parte Este de la isla de Santa Cruz, han resultado en la identificaci\'on de una variabilidad espacial significativa en la explotaci\'on de silex a lo largo del tiempo. Considerando que la extracci\'on de silex durante el Holoceno Medio parece haber sido de tipo oportunista y dispersa a trav\'es del paisaje, actividades semejantes durante el Holoceno Tard\'io se volvieron cada vez m\'as circunscritas al intensificarse la producci\'on de microlitos. Estas tendencias en la adquisici\'on de silex son interpretadas dentro de un contexto de transformaci\'on en estrategias de subsistencia, producci\'on de artefactos y movilidad residencial en las Islas del norte del Canal de Santa B\'arbara, transformaciones con profundas implicaciones en las caracter\'isticas espaciales y temporales de explotaci\'on l\'itica en la prehistoria.},

  abstract = {A number of radiocarbon dates, both published and unpublished have been obtained from archaeological deposits across the Teouma site on the island of Efate in Vanuatu. These are on a range of materials from the midden and associated cemetery including charcoal (13) and shell (7) as well as a number of less commonly dated 14C sample types including bone from 2 terrestrial giant tortoises (?Meiolania damelipi), 8 pigs (Sus scrofa) and 2 chickens (Gallus gallus). Thirty-six human bone collagen dates and 5 Conus sp. shell ring artifacts from the cemetery context have been discussed in detail elsewhere (Petchey et al., 2014). In this paper, we evaluate the radiocarbon data according to observed contextual associations and established understandings of 14C offsets, and collate all available information in a Bayesian framework to establish the age and duration of the settlement at Teouma. This analysis provides a maximum age range for the Lapita deposits of between 3000 and 2560 cal BP and a most likely start date of 2920\textendash 2870 cal BP and end date of 2870\textendash 2750 cal BP (68.2\% prob.). This is slightly younger age for the deposits than previously reported, but is in keeping with evaluation of the burials themselves, the majority of which are dated to between 2940 and 2720 cal BP. This age range indicates that the site was in use at the same time as colonization events in Tonga (2850\textendash 2830 cal BP) and Fiji (3020\textendash 2860 cal BP), and supports the hypothesis that Vanuatu was at the center of a region-wide interaction sphere for several generations after initial settlement.},

Often situated in coastal beach ridges or sand dunes, sites exhibit horizontal and vertical disturbances, while datable materials such as wood charcoal are typically highly degraded, or derived from old trees or drift wood and bone collagen rarely survives in the tropical conditions. Shell, therefore, is the most logical material for dating Pacific sites since it is resistant to alteration, can be sampled to ensure only the last few seasons of growth are represented and is often closely tied to human economic activities. However, shell radiocarbon (14C) dating has been plagued by interpretive problems largely due to our limited knowledge of the 14C cycle in near shore marine and estuarine environments. Consequently, shell dates are typically ignored in regional chronometric evaluations and often avoided for dating altogether. Recent advances in our understanding of the source of shell 14C content as well as the development of the first South Pacific Gyre model of changing marine 14C over time, combined with Bayesian statistical modelling, have now provided us with insight into the value of these shell radiocarbon dates, enabling a revision of the age of the To'aga site on Ofu Island, an early occupation site associated with the initial Polynesian Plainware period in Samoa, the earliest use of which is now dated to between 2782 and 2667 cal BP.},

Here, we describe the discovery of three stratified and buried archaeological sites in the Nefud Desert, which includes the oldest dated occupation for the region. The stone tool assemblages are identified as a Middle Palaeolithic industry that includes Levallois manufacturing methods and the production of tools on flakes. Hominin occupations correspond with humid periods, particularly Marine Isotope Stages 7 and 5 of the Late Pleistocene. The Middle Palaeolithic occupations were situated along the Jubbah palaeolake-shores, in a grassland setting with some trees. Populations procured different raw materials across the lake region to manufacture stone tools, using the implements to process plants and animals. To reach the Jubbah palaeolake, Middle Palaeolithic populations travelled into the ameliorated Nefud Desert interior, possibly gaining access from multiple directions, either using routes from the north and west (the Levant and the Sinai), the north (the Mesopotamian plains and the Euphrates basin), or the east (the Persian Gulf). The Jubbah stone tool assemblages have their own suite of technological characters, but have types reminiscent of both African Middle Stone Age and Levantine Middle Palaeolithic industries. Comparative inter-regional analysis of core technology indicates morphological similarities with the Levantine Tabun C assemblage, associated with human fossils controversially identified as either Neanderthals or Homo sapiens.},

  abstract = {Only Henry Petroski, author of The Pencil, could make one never pick up a paper clip again without being overcome with feelings of awe and reverence. In his new book the author examines a host of techno-trivia questions - how the fork got its tines, why Scotch tape is called that, how the paper clip evolved, how the Post-it note came to be, how the zipper was named, why aluminum cans have hollow bottoms - and provides us with answers that both astonish and challenge the imagination. In addition to an extended discussion of knives, forks, spoons, and other common devices, the author explains how the interplay of social and technical factors affects the development and use of such things as plastic bags, fast-food packaging, push-button telephones, and other modern conveniences. Throughout the book familiar objects serve to illustrate the general principles behind the evolution of all products of invention and engineering. Petroski shows, by way of these examples as well as a probing look at the patent process, that the single most important driving force behind technological change is the failure of existing devices to live up to their promise. As shortcomings become evident and articulated, new and "improved" versions of artifacts come into being through long and involved processes variously known as research and development, invention, and engineering. He further demonstrates how the evolving forms of technology generally are altered by our very use of them, and how they, in turn, alter our social and cultural behavior. In this wonderful mixture of history, biography, and design theory, Henry Petroski brings us to an understanding of an essential question: By what mechanism do theshapes and forms of our made world come to be?},

We undertake technological analyses of stone artefacts from a  late 14th century Ma\textasciimacron{} ori occupation at Tauroa Point, Northland, New Zealand. From the results we infer artefact production strategies, occupation duration, and population movements to and from this locale. Our analysis identified more than 13 stone types, with varied functional properties, and from sources up to 300 km away. The most abundant were obsidian, chert, silicified tuff, and fine-grained volcanics, including materials from the important source of Mayor Island and Tahanga. Use of exotic raw materials, especially when local equivalents were available, indicates population mobility and/or interaction with social groups residing elsewhere. The technological analysis considered tool production, use, and discard patterns as indicated by core and flake size, form, and cortex patterns; flake scar properties; and core-flake ratios. The results inform on differences in the nature and intensity of raw material use, patterns of artefact movement to and from the site, and occupation duration. Notably, preferential and intensive use of non-local obsidian suggests a social component to its procurement and use. Local obsidian, chert and silicified tuff were used less intensively, and possibly for different functions. Overall, an extended but not necessarily permanent occupation involving a variety of activities is indicated. The Tauroa Point site was clearly one component of a larger regional settlement system that involved significant mobility, with connections to other localities within the region, and quite possibly beyond.},

This new method of flake production was accompanied by significant behavioral changes in hominin populations. The emergence of this technological advance is considered homogeneous in the European archaeological record at the Marine isotopic stage (MIS) 9/MIS 8 boundary. In this paper we report a series of combined electron spin resonance/U-series dates on mammal bones and teeth recovered from the lower units of San Bernardino Cave (Italy) and the technological analyses of the lithic assemblages. The San Bernardino Cave has yielded the earliest evidence of Levallois production on the Italian Peninsula recovered to date. In addition to our results and the review of the archaeological record, we describe the chronological and geographical differences between European territories and diversities in terms of technological developments. The belated emergence of Levallois technology in Italy compared to western Europe corresponds to the late Italian Neanderthal speciation event. The new radiometric dates and the technological analyses of San Bernardino Cave raise the issue of the different roles of glacial refugia in the peopling and the spread of innovative flaking strategies in Europe during the late Middle Pleistocene.},

  abstract = {The introduction of the Levallois method in Europe is considered the technological innovation that marked the beginning of the Middle Palaeolithic. In North-Central Europe, early evidence of this new concept of flake production is dated at the junction between Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 9 and MIS 8, a period that showed a deterioration of climatic conditions, i.e. a change from forested to cold tundra\textendash steppe vegetation and dispersal of the Mammuthus\textendash Coelodonta faunal complex from artic territories. This study aims to contribute new data to the current debate by exploring the lithic assemblages of the Markkleeberg and Zwochau open-air sites in Germany. Technological analysis reveals the introduction of the Levallois method in association with the development of the local unidirectional core technology. This pattern is common in other sites of North-Central Europe. This modification in the technical behaviour of hunter-gatherers is interpreted as a technological adaptation in response to the new faunal complex composed of seasonal migratory animals.

However, a reliance on typological descriptions has obscured the technological details of this development. An attribute analysis of six well-dated utility-ware assemblages from southwestern Colorado indicates that corrugation appeared first in this region during the eighth century A. D. as wide, non-overlapping coils left unsmoothed around jar necks. During the ninth and tenth centuries, the variety and frequency of neck-banding increased with the introduction of narrower coils, overlapping of adjacent coils, and incising and indenting of coil surfaces. By the early eleventh century, one recent neck-banding variant, narrow, substantially overlapped and indented coils, replaced almost all others, and was extended over the entire exterior surface of jars for the first time. Performance benefits of this full-body, indented corrugation may explain its rapid adoption in southwestern Colorado.},

Because of the demonstrated correlation between phenotypic and genotypic similarities, studies of cranial form, most notably cranial measurements, occupy a central role in modern biodistance studies. This paper examines the results of multivariate statistical procedures applied to measurements recorded in modern and prehistoric mandibles from the Pacific, including the largest sample of intact Lapita mandibles from the SAC site on Watom Island, New Britain, Papua New Guinea. The results of this analysis demonstrate that the Lapita-associated mandibles from the SAC site are morphologically most similar to mandibles from eastern Melanesia and the Polynesian mandible series are closest to mandibles from Southeast Asia. As demonstrated in earlier biological distance studies based on craniometric data, the results of this new biodistance study support an ancestral Polynesian homeland in Wallacea and not one within geographic Melanesia.},

  abstract = {Nature has recently depicted the empirical advancements of the theory of evolution as a confrontation between ``reformists'', that claim for an urgent rethinking of the standard neo-Darwinian approach including so far neglected factors and processes, and ``conservatives'' who reply ``all is well'' about the current evolutionary research programme based on genetic variation and natural selection. The fight is mainly around genetic reductionism, but it seems inconclusive. Reformists stress very important factors, but they are still missing a coherent proposal about the architecture of the future extended evolutionary theory. Conservative react defensively, relying just on non-essential add-ons to the old and stable neo-Darwinian core. We analyze the debate and we propose an interpretation. Evolutionary biology is a rapidly expanding field. The bone of contention is how to update and extend the central core of the Darwinian legacy. We propose here the idea that what is happening in the field today is a development of the evolutionary research programme, whose structure is composed of a set of compatible and integrated evolutionary patterns. Evolutionary biology has been extended over its history by the inclusion of more and more patterns, rather than by revision to core theory. Niles Eldredge's ``Hierarchy Theory'' is an example of global structure (meta-theory) aiming at incorporating and unifying the currently observed evolutionary patterns.},

  abstract = {A fundamental question in evolutionary biology is the relative importance of selection and genetic architecture in determining evolutionary rates. Adaptive evolution can be described by the multivariate breeders' equation ( ), which predicts evolutionary change for a suite of phenotypic traits ( ) as a product of directional selection acting on them ({$\beta$}) and the genetic variance\textendash covariance matrix for those traits (G). Despite being empirically challenging to estimate, there are enough published estimates of G and {$\beta$} to allow for synthesis of general patterns across species. We use published estimates to test the hypotheses that there are systematic differences in the rate of evolution among trait types, and that these differences are, in part, due to genetic architecture. We find some evidence that sexually selected traits exhibit faster rates of evolution compared with life\-history or morphological traits. This difference does not appear to be related to stronger selection on sexually selected traits. Using numerous proposed approaches to quantifying the shape, size and structure of G, we examine how these parameters relate to one another, and how they vary among taxonomic and trait groupings. Despite considerable variation, they do not explain the observed differences in evolutionary rates.},

Whereas the deep sea record of global climatic change provides indirect evidence for an increase in C4 vegetation with a shift towards a cooler, drier and more variable global climatic regime beginning approximately 3 million years ago (Ma), evidence for grassland-dominated ecosystems in continental Africa and hominin activities within such ecosystems have been lacking.
Methodology/Principal Findings: We report stable isotopic analyses of pedogenic carbonates and ungulate enamel, as well as faunal data from ,2.0 Ma archeological occurrences at Kanjera South, Kenya. These document repeated hominin activities within a grassland-dominated ecosystem.
Conclusions/Significance: These data demonstrate what hitherto had been speculated based on indirect evidence: that grassland-dominated ecosystems did in fact exist during the Plio-Pleistocene, and that early Homo was active in open settings. Comparison with other Oldowan occurrences indicates that by 2.0 Ma hominins, almost certainly of the genus Homo, used a broad spectrum of habitats in East Africa, from open grassland to riparian forest. This strongly contrasts with the habitat usage of Australopithecus, and may signal an important shift in hominin landscape usage.},

They deployed different technological strategies to more intensively utilize these hard, non-local raw materials. Artifacts were used for a variety of tasks, including butchering small antelopes probably obtained by hunting, working wood, working soft plant material, and processing underground storage organs. These data suggest that the Kanjera hominins utilized a technological system that allowed them to extract nutrient dense animal and plant foods from their environment. This shift towards the acquisition of nutritious, hard-to-acquire foods in packets large enough to be shared may have facilitated brain and body size expansion in the genus Homo.},

We used temporally well-constrained sedimentological and paleoenvironmental data to investigate environmental dynamics before and after the appearance of the early MSA in the Olorgesailie basin, Kenya. In contrast to the Acheulean archeological record in the same basin, MSA sites are associated with a markedly different faunal community, more pronounced erosion-deposition cycles, tectonic activity, and enhanced wet-dry variability. Aspects of Acheulean technology in this region imply that, as early as 615,000 years ago, greater stone material selectivity and wider resource procurement coincided with an increased pace of land-lake fluctuation, potentially anticipating the adaptability of MSA hominins.},

  abstract = {The main criteria for assessing the load-bearing behaviour and risk potential of monolithic glass are its fragmentation and the morphology of the fragments. These depend strongly non-linearly on the strain energy density present in the glass at the time of fracture, which can be converted into fracture energy. Thus, the design and optimization of structural glazing in engineering requires both knowledge of the relevant parameters and mechanisms during the fracture process in glass and an understanding of the characteristics of the fracture structure. Based on fracture mechanics considerations and comprehensive experimental investigations, various aspects and physical quantities of fracture behaviour as well as characteristics and parameters of fracture pattern morphology of fragmented, tempered soda-lime glass were studied and correlated with the stored strain energy. The relationship between fragmentation behavior and strain energy was elaborated using the energy criterion in Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) related to the initial strain energy before fragmentation and in the post-fracture state. Furthermore, a machine learning inspired approach for the prediction of 2D macro-scale fragmentation of tempered glass was developed and elaborated based on fracture mechanics considerations and statistical analysis of the fracture pattern morphology. A method was deduced and applied in which the fracture pattern of tempered glass is predicted and simulated by Voronoi tessellation of point patterns based on Bayesian spatial point statistics fed with energy conditions in LEFM.},

  abstract = {Culturally transmitted behavior can be structured in its performance both geographically and temporally, in terms of where and when implements are made and used on the landscape (what Ingold calls ``the taskscape''). Yet cultural transmission theory has not yet explored the consequences of behaviors transmitted differently due to their enactment at different taskscape locations, what Tostevin calls ``taskscape visibility.'' Here, we use computer simulations to explore how taskscape visibility and forager mobility affect the diversity of two selectively neutral culturally transmitted traits within a single population of social learners. The trait that can be transmitted from residential bases only (lower taskscape visibility) shows greater diversity than the trait that can be transmitted from residential bases and logistical camps (higher taskscape visibility). In addition, increased logistical mobility has a positive effect on the diversity of the trait with the lower taskscape visibility while it generally shows little to no effect on the diversity of the trait with higher taskscape visibility. Without an appreciation for the ways in which taskscape visibility and mobility can structure cultural transmission in space and through time, the difference in the observed equilibrium diversity levels of the two traits might be incorrectly interpreted as resulting from qualitatively different forms of biased cultural transmission. The results of our simulation experiment suggest that researchers may need to take the taskscape visibility into account when inferring cultural transmission from archaeological data.},

Cognitively based explanations, which presume either lack of ability to innovate or extreme conformism, do not account for the totality of the empirical patterns. Following recent research, this study explores the effects of demographic factors on rates of culture change and diversification. We investigate whether the appearance of stability in early Paleolithic technologies could result from frequent extinctions of local subpopulations within a persistent metapopulation. A spatially explicit agent-based model was constructed to test the influence of local extinction rate on three general cultural patterns that archaeologists might observe in the material record: total diversity, differentiation among spatially defined groups, and the rate of cumulative change. The model shows that diversity, differentiation, and the rate of cumulative cultural change would be strongly affected by local extinction rates, in some cases mimicking the results of conformist cultural transmission. The results have implications for understanding spatial and temporal patterning in ancient material culture.},

To accomplish this we develop a phylogenetic analysis of the early Arctic Small Tool tradition (ASTt) of eastern Siberia and northern North America. The use of early ASTt data permits us to monitor change while largely eliminating the possibility of influence by other cultural traditions. It also allows us to explore lingering questions regarding ASTt migrations. We examine correlations between tree branch length as a measure of cultural differentiation and geographic distance (from the oldest site), mean radiocarbon date, and three measures of terrestrial ecological variation. Outcomes suggest that only geographic distance and radiocarbon dates correlate with tree branch length. We offer conclusions regarding ASTt evolution and migrations along with ideas for future research.},

  abstract = {Sullivan and Rozen's (1985) debitage typology has been proposed as a method for measuring the effects of variation in lithic reduction by describing ``distinctive assemblages.'' This is in contrast to many traditional analytical methods oriented toward identifying the effects of lithic reduction techniques on individual flakes. Debate over the use of the typology has focused primarily on the ability of the typology to accurately measure variation in lithic reduction behavior, and secondarily on the role of experimental studies in archaeology. In this paper I present an analysis designed to estimate the reliability and validity of the typology. An experimental design is developed to permit data collection with minimal analyst induced random or systematic error. Principal components analysis and the coefficient theta demonstrate that the typology provides reliable or replicable results when applied to debitage assemblages of similar technological origin. Further principal components analysis suggests that the instrument is of limited utility in recognizing effects of variation in reduction activities associated with highly vitreous lithic raw materials. A means of expanding the typology and increasing its accuracy in archaeological pattern recognition is presented.

La tipolog\'ia de los restos l\'iticos de Sullivan y Rozen (1985) ha sido propuesta como un m\'etodo por medir el efecto de la variabilidad en ``reducci\'on distintiva'' de cada conjunto. Este m\'otodo contrasta con otros m\'atodos analit\'icos tradicionales, que est\'an orientados a la identificci\'on de los efectos de las t\'ecnicas de reducci\'on l\'itica en las lascas individuates. El debate sobre los usos de la tipolog\'ia se har enfocado primeramente en la abilidad de la tipolog\'ia para de tectar exactamente la variaci\'on en el proceso de reducci\'on l\'itica, y segundamente en elpapel de los estudios arqueol\'ogicos experimentales. En este art\'iculo, presento un an\'alisis dise\~nado para estimar la confiabilidad y validez de la tipolog\'ia. Un diseho experimental estd desarollado para permitir lafue colleci\'on de datos con un mm\'imo de errores inducidos casual y sistematicamente. La an\'alisis de los componentes principales y el coeficiente theta demuestra que la tipolog\'ia produce resultados confiables y reproducible cuando se aplica a conjuntos de restos de origen tecnico similar. El andlisis adicional de los componentes principales sugiere que la tipolog\'ia es de utilidad limitada para reconocer los efectos de variaci\'on en actividades de reducci\'on. Este papel ampl\'ia la tipologia y aumenta la precisi\'on para reconocer patrones arqueol\'ogicos.},

  abstract = {This study investigates morphological differences between flakes produced via ``core and flake'' technologies and those resulting from bifacial shaping strategies. We investigate systematic variation between two technological groups of flakes using experimentally produced assemblages, and then apply the experimental model to the Cutting 10 Mid -Pleistocene archaeological collection from Elandsfontein, South Africa. We argue that a specific set of independent variables\textemdash and their interactions\textemdash including external platform angle, platform depth, measures of thickness variance and flake curvature should distinguish between these two technological groups. The role of these variables in technological group separation was further investigated using the Generalized Linear Model as well as Linear Discriminant Analysis. The Discriminant model was used to classify archaeological flakes from the Cutting 10 locality in terms of their probability of association, within either experimentally developed technological group. The results indicate that the selected independent variables play a central role in separating core and flake from bifacial technologies. Thickness evenness and curvature had the greatest effect sizes in both the Generalized Linear and Discriminant models. Interestingly the interaction between thickness evenness and platform depth was significant and played an important role in influencing technological group membership. The identified interaction emphasizes the complexity in attempting to distinguish flake production strategies based on flake morphological attributes. The results of the discriminant function analysis demonstrate that the majority of flakes at the Cutting 10 locality were not associated with the production of the numerous Large Cutting Tools found at the site, which corresponds with previous suggestions regarding technological behaviors reflected in this assemblage.},

  abstract = {African archaic humans dated to around 1,0 Ma share morphological affinities with Homo ergaster and appear distinct in cranio-dental morphology from those of the Middle Pleistocene that are referred to Homo heidelbergensis. This observation suggests a taxonomic and phylogenetic discontinuity in Africa that ranges across the Matuyama/Brunhes reversal (780 ka). Yet, the fossil record between roughly 900 and 600 ka is notoriously poor. In this context, the Early Stone Age site of Gombore II, in the Melka Kunture formation (Upper Awash, Ethiopia), provides a privileged case-study. In the Acheulean layer of Gombore II, somewhat more recent than 875 {$\pm$}10 ka, two large cranial fragments were discovered in 1973 and 1975 respectively: a partial left parietal (Melka Kunture 1) and a right portion of the frontal bone (Melka Kunture 2), which probably belonged to the same cranium. We present here the first detailed description and computer-assisted reconstruction of the morphology of the cranial vault pertaining to these fossil fragments. Our analysis suggest that the human fossil specimen from Gombore II fills a phenetic gap between Homo ergaster and Homo heidelbergensis. This appears in agreement with the chronology of such a partial cranial vault, which therefore represents at present one of the best available candidates (if any) for the origin of Homo heidelbergensis in Africa.},

  abstract = {From the perspective of Central and South America, the peopling of the New World was a complex process lasting thousands of years and involving multiple waves of Pleistocene and early Holocene period immigrants entering into the neotropics. These Paleoindian colonists initially brought with them technologies developed for adaptation to environments and resources found in North America. As the ice age ended across the New World people adapted more generalized stone tools to exploit changing environments and resources. In the neotropics these changes would have been pronounced as patchy forests and grasslands gave way to broadleaf tropical forests. We document a late Pleistocene/early Holocene stone tool tradition from Belize, located in southern Mesoamerica. This represents the first endogenous Paleoindian stone tool technocomplex recovered from well dated stratigraphic contexts for Mesoamerica. Previously designated Lowe, these artifacts share multiple features with contemporary North and South American Paleoindian tool types. Once hafted, these bifaces appear to have served multiple functions for cutting, hooking, thrusting, or throwing. The tools were developed at a time of technological regionalization reflecting the diverse demands of a period of pronounced environmental change and population movement. Combined stratigraphic, technological, and population paleogenetic data suggests that there were strong ties between lowland neotropic regions at the onset of the Holocene.},

Hauanio shares the wisdom and practice of early cliff-top fishing know as hang-baiting in his lecture.

While modern ulua fishing equipment and tournaments pull countless fish from the sea each year, some Hawaiians are revisiting the traditions of their ancestors for more sustainable fishing practices.

Born and raised in Kalapana, Hauanio grew up at the ocean throwing net, diving, aama (black crab) gathering, pounding opihi (limpets) and fishing in the kau laau, or maamaa, style as his father and grandfather did before him. Kau laau was passed down from generations in the Kalapana area.

From 2008 to 2014, the Puana Ka `Ike (Imparting Knowledge) Lecture Series provided an educational forum for anyone interested in a deeper understanding of Hawaiian culture, history, and tradition. 

This lecture series covers a diverse range of topics such as Hawaiian moon phases and the Hawaiian perspective of the environment.

Puana Ka `Ike Partners include: Kamehameha Schools, University of Hawai`i at Hilo K\=ipuka Native Hawaiian Student Center, Eia Hawai`i Lecture Series, Keauhou Beach Resort, and The Kohala Center.}

  abstract = {Many researchers have hypothesized an analogous, and possibly evolutionary, relationship between Paleolithic stone tool manufacture and language. This study uses a unique design to investigate how spoken language may affect the transmission of learning to make stone tools and comes to surprising results that may have important implications for our views of this relationship. We conducted an experiment to test the effect of verbal communication on large core biface manufacture during the earliest stages of learning. Previously untrained flintknappers were assigned to two different communication conditions, one with and one without spoken language, and were instructed to replicate the bifaces produced by the same instructor. The attempted bifaces (total = ) from the two groups were compared using an Elliptical Fourier analysis, the Flip Test, and a rating scale by an independent lithicist. We found no significant difference in the overall shape, symmetry, or other measures of skill among the two groups, using all three of these methods. Analysis of the , debitage elements from the experiment, however, revealed that the two groups set up their striking platforms in fundamentally different ways. The nonverbal group produced more efficient flakes than the verbal group, as evidenced by the significantly higher ratios of platform width to platform thickness and size to mass of the nonverbal subjects' flakes. These results indicate that verbal interaction is not a necessary component of the transmission of the overall shape, form, and symmetry of a biface in modern human novice subjects, and it can hinder the progress of verbal learners because of their tendency to over-imitate actions of the instructor that exceed their current skill set.},

However, these efforts are impeded by heavy vegetation and rugged terrain, which limit the implementation and productivity of traditional archaeological methods. Aerial lidar data provide an opportunity to survey large archaeological landscapes effectively and efficiently in these environments. In this paper, we present the results of a lidar-based survey and analysis of community-level spatial patterning for at sites in the Manu'a Group of American Samoa. Using lidar data in conjunction with pedestrian survey results, we first established the suitability of lidar for identifying archaeological features, and then applied the technique to a previously unexamined landscape. We were able to record archaeological remains and analyse the data to discern spatial patterning in their distribution. The patterning of these remains is broadly comparable, though not identical, to that of three other settlement zones on Olosega and the adjacent island of Ofu, which previously were intensively surveyed. The differences in the characteristics and distribution of structural features within and between these four settlement zones may reflect differences in social status and ranking.},

Using niche construction, a concept that has proven effective to understand subsistence change elsewhere, we examine pathways of agricultural change in Polynesia. We highlight the prevalence of niche construction in agricultural trajectories in the region, using both a summary of evidence through Polynesia as well as a targeted case study, and illustrate a framework for organizing those trajectories. In doing so, we build on previous attempts at examining the relationship between cultivation and adaptation in the region, which, given that Polynesia is thought of as a model system for investigating human-environmental relationships, can be used as a more general model of agricultural change globally.},

However, once established, invasive species can significantly change the composition of the communities that they invade. The first step to disentangling the direction of causality is to discern whether a relationship with other vegetation exists at all. Carduus nutans and C. acanthoides are similar invasive thistles, which have caused substantial economic damage worldwide. We assessed the associations between the thistles and the standing flora in four sites in central Pennsylvania in which they co-occur. After sampling nearly 2000 plots of 1 m2, we used partial Mantel tests to assess the differences in vegetation between thistle and non-thistle plots after accounting for location, and non-metric multidimensional scaling to visualize differences among plots and sites. We found significant differences in community composition in plots with and without Carduus thistles. The non-native species Sisymbrium officinale and Coronilla varia were consistently associated with the presence of Carduus thistles. Several species were associated with areas that were free of Carduus thistles, including an important non-native pasture species (Trifolium repens). We found no evidence for differences in composition between plots with C. nutans versus C. acanthoides, suggesting that they have similar associations with the vegetation community. We conclude that even at the within-field scale, areas invaded by Carduus thistles have different vegetation associations than uninvaded areas, allowing us to target future research about the role of vegetation structure in resisting and responding to invasion.},

Archaeological implications of this view of social networks are considered for the part-agricultural inhabitants of central New Mexico during the Pithouse period (ca. A.D. 900\textemdash 1250). Spatial patterning of climatic variables suggests that social networks at least 50 km in extent and oriented in an east-southeastern direction from the focal site toward the Sierra Blanca region could have provided access to extralocal resources during years of poor local productivity. Similarity of ceramic assemblages (measured by Brainerd\textemdash Robinson coefficients) between the focal site and sites in the proposed alternative resource area confirms some degree of social contact during the Pithouse period; dissimilar ceramic assemblages from comparably distant sites to the west (in the Socorro area) indicate that geographic distance alone is not a good predictor of social interactions in this region.

            Las interacciones sociales dentro de una regi\'on pueden reducir el riesgo de crises ambientales puesto que facilitan el acceso a recursos en otras \'areas. Las implicaciones arqueol\'ogicas de esta perspectiva sobre redes sociales se examinan para las poblaciones semi-agr\'icolas del centro de Nuevo M\'exico durante el per\'iodo Pithouse (ca. 900\textemdash 1250 D.C.). El patr\'on espacial de variables clim\'aticas sugiere que redes sociales que se extendieron por lo menos 50 km y se orientaron en direcci\'on este\textemdash sudeste desde el sitio focal hacia la regi\'on de Sierra Blanca pudieron proveer acceso a recursos extralocales durante los a\~nos de baja producci\'on local. La similitud de los conjuntos cer\'amicos (medida con coeficientes Brainerd\textemdash Robinson) entre el sitio focal y sitios en el \'area de recursos propuesta como alternativa confirma que hubo cierto grado de contacto social durante el per\'iodo Pithouse; diferencias en los conjuntos cer\'amicos de sitios localizados a distancias comparables hacia el oeste (en el \'area de Socorro) indican que la distancia geogr\'afica considerada individualmente no es una variable adecuada para predecir interacciones sociales en esta regi\'on},

  abstract = {Experimental work in the field of language evolution has shown that novel signal systems become more structured over time. In a recent paper, Kirby, Tamariz, Cornish, and Smith (2015) argued that compositional languages can emerge only when languages are transmitted across multiple generations. In the current paper, we show that compositional languages can emerge in a closed community within a single generation. We conducted a communication experiment in which we tested the emergence of linguistic structure in different micro-societies of four participants, who interacted in alternating dyads using an artificial language to refer to novel meanings. Importantly, the communication included two real-world aspects of language acquisition and use, which introduce compressibility pressures: (a) multiple interaction partners and (b) an expanding meaning space. Our results show that languages become significantly more structured over time, with participants converging on shared, stable, and compositional lexicons. These findings indicate that new learners are not necessary for the formation of linguistic structure within a community, and have implications for related fields such as developing sign languages and creoles.},

Layer 4 from the site of MenezDregan I is the last occupation of this deposit, at the boundary between the Lower and Middle Palaeolithic (Ravon and Monnier, 2013). Geological correlations (Laforge, 2012; Monnier et al., 2001) tend to place layer 4 in OIS 9 or 7, although the only TL dating obtained for this level gave an age of 223 {$\pm$} 23 ky (Mercier et al., 2004). This study focuses on the lithic industry from the 1991-2004 excavations and was undertaken in order to capture the various types of technical behaviour that could illustrate the transition between the Lower and Middle Palaeolithic. We present the lithic industry of this layer, which simultaneously combines Lower Palaeolithic characteristics, such as large quantities of pebble tools (due to the environment of the site), and the emergence of characteristics that are common to the Middle Palaeolithic, such as standardisation of flake production, or adapting knapping methods to the dimensions of the raw materials (discoid knapping for quartzite, bipolar flaking on an anvil for small flint pebbles). The lithic industry from layer 4 and its three levels (4a, 4b and 4c) has been analysed. Layer 4 of Menez-Dregan I has been attributed to the ``Colombanian'' by J.-L. Monnier on the basis of the composition of its lithic industry (Monnier, 1996): a predominance of cobble tools amongst heavy-duty tools, retouched light-duty tools on flake-supports comprising mostly notches and denticulates, and a knapping method akin to the ``SSDA - Clactonian'' (wide butts rarely faceted, prominent bulbs, wide open flaking angles, resulting from an alternate flaking of the cores; ``syst\`eme par surface de d\'ebitage altern\'ee'', Forestier, 1993). The Levallois method is absent, bifaces are absent or extremely rare, and there are few scrapers. The Colombanian proves to be a Lower Palaeolithic industry contemporary with the classic Acheulean, but typologically distinct. However, standardisation of flake production leads us to foresee a change in the lithic industry of layer 4, and allows us to highlight a transitional period from the Lower Palaeolithic to the Middle Palaeolithic in the latest occupation of this deposit. This study is a contribution to the documentation of the diversity and variability of Lower and Middle Palaeolithic lithic industries, demonstrating that the large amount of cobble tools in layer 4 is an unchanged component due to environmental constraints.},

We disagree with the implication of the treadmill model, based on Dual-Inheritance Theory, that population size is the driver of cultural complexity. The treadmill model reduces the evolution of artifact complexity, measured by the number of parts, to the statistical fact that individuals with high skills are more likely to be found in a larger population than in a smaller population. However, for the treadmill model to operate as claimed, implausibly high skill levels must be assumed. Contrary to the treadmill model, the risk hypothesis for the complexity of artifacts relates the number of parts to increased functional efficiency of implements. Empirically, all data on hunter-gatherer artifact complexity support the risk hypothesis and reject the treadmill model. Still, there are conditions under which increased technological complexity relates to increased population size, but the dependency does not occur in the manner expressed in the treadmill model. Instead, it relates to population size when the support system for the technology requires a large population size. If anything, anthropology and ecology suggest that cultural complexity generates high population density rather than the other way around.},

  abstract = {A recent article has suggested that maintenance of complex tools and associated tasks in a group depends on the presence of skilled individuals to serve as targets for imitation. The expected number of skilled target individuals, it is argued, relates to the population size. It is predicted that population size and maximum complexity of tools and/or tasks should correlate, hence a decrease in population size could lead to maladaptive loss of skills. Data from Tasmania are said to support the argument. However, the argument neither agrees with the archaeological data from Tasmania nor ethnographic observations on hunter-gatherer societies. Instead of being an example of a group that underwent maladaptive loss, the indigenous people of Tasmania appear to have used tools sufficient for the tasks at hand. An alternative model is proposed that distinguishes between motor skills and knowledge needed to do tasks effectively and takes into account assessment of the time cost for developing skills. Loss of skills more likely relates to change in the mode of resource procurement or change in technology rather than a shortage of skilled, target individuals due to decrease in population size.

            R\'esum\'e
            Un art\'iculo reciente ha sugerido que el mantenimiento de herramientas complejas y tareas asociadas en un grupo depende de la presencia de individuos expertos quienes sirven como ejemplos para emulaci\'on. El n\'umero previsto de los individuos expertos, se discute, se relaciona con el tama\~no de la poblaci\'on. Se predice que el tama\~no de la poblaci\'on y la complejidad de herramientas y/o tareas deben correlacionar, por lo tanto una disminuci\'on en tama\~no de la poblaci\'on podr\'ia resultar en la p\'erdida mal-adaptante de habilidades. Los datos de Tasmania se citan para apoyar la discusi\'on. Sin embargo, la discusi\'on ni conviene con los datos arqueol\'ogicos de Tasmania, ni las observaciones etnogr\'ificas en sociedades de cazadores-recolectores. En vez de ser un ejemplo de un grupo que experiment\'o p\'erdida mal-adaptante, la gente ind\'igena de Tasmania aparece haber utilizado las herramientas suficientes para sus tareas actuales. Se propone un modelo alternativo cual distingue entre las habilidades de motor y el conocimiento necesario para hacer tareas con eficacia, y eval\'ua el tiempo que costar\'ia para aprender nuevas habilidades. La p\'erdida de habilidades se relaciona m\'as probablemente con cambios en el modo de la conseguir recursos o cambios en tecnolog\'ia, m\'as bien que una escasez de individuos experto debido a la disminuci\'on de poblaci\'on.},

It follows the early expansions of hominins out of Africa, accomplished by Homo erectus and then Homo neanderthalensis.
The model proposes a "single origin" of Homo sapiens in the taxonomic sense, precluding
parallel evolution of traits considered anatomically modern in other regions, but not precluding multiple admixture between H. sapiens and archaic humans in Europe and Asia. H. sapiens most likely developed in the Horn of Africa between 300,000 and 200,000 years ago. The "recent African origin" model proposes that all modern non-African populations are substantially descended from populations of H. sapiens that left Africa after that time.
There were at least several "out-of-Africa" dispersals of modern humans, possibly beginning as early as 270,000 years ago, including 215,000 years ago to at least Greece, and certainly via northern Africa about 130,000 to 115,000 years ago.
These early waves appear to have mostly died out or retreated by 80,000 years ago.The most significant "recent" wave took place about 70,000\textendash 50,000 years ago, via the so-called "Southern Route", spreading rapidly along the coast of Asia and reaching Australia by around 65,000\textendash 50,000 years ago, (though some researchers question the earlier Australian dates and place the arrival of humans there at 50,000 years ago at earliest, while others have suggested that these first settlers of Australia may represent an older wave before the more significant out of Africa migration and thus not necessarily be ancestral to the region's later inhabitants) while Europe was populated by an early offshoot which settled the Near East and Europe less than 55,000 years ago.In the 2010s, studies in population genetics uncovered evidence of interbreeding that occurred between H. sapiens and archaic humans in Eurasia and Oceania but not in Africa, indicating that all non-African modern population groups, while mostly derived from early H. sapiens, are to a lesser extent also descended from regional variants of archaic humans.},

  abstract = {Population size is a major determinant of extinction risk. However, controversy remains as to how large populations need to be to ensure persistence. It is generally believed that minimum viable population sizes (MVPs) would be highly specific, depending on the environmental and life history characteristics of the species. We used population viability analysis to estimate MVPs for 102 species. We define a minimum viable population size as one with a 99\% probability of persistence for 40 generations. The models are comprehensive and include age-structure, catastrophes, demographic stochasticity, environmental stochasticity, and inbreeding depression. The mean and median estimates of MVP were 7316 and 5816 adults, respectively. This is slightly larger than, but in general agreement with, previous estimates of MVP. MVPs did not differ significantly among major taxa, or with latitude or trophic level, but were negatively correlated with population growth rate and positively correlated with the length of the study used to parameterize the model. A doubling of study duration increased the estimated MVP by approximately 67\%. The increase in extinction risk is associated with greater temporal variation in population size for models built from longer data sets. Short-term studies consistently underestimate the true variances for demographic parameters in populations. Thus, the lack of long-term studies for endangered species leads to widespread underestimation of extinction risk. The results of our simulations suggest that conservation programs, for wild populations, need to be designed to conserve habitat capable of supporting approximately 7000 adult vertebrates in order to ensure long-term persistence.},

The data corroborating this Turnover Pulse Hypothesis derive from both large mammal and micromammal data, though the fossil record of the former is much more abundant in this interval. New micromammal fossils recovered from ca. 2.4~Ma deposits at locality A.L. 894, low in the Busidima Formation in the Hadar study area of the Afar region, Ethiopia, reveal a significant faunal turnover when compared with previously published material from older 3.2~Ma micromammal assemblages from the Hadar Formation deposits. The results support the hypothesis of a major faunal transition, but larger sample sizes and more extensive temporal sampling are needed to refine the time and rate of change within this interval at Hadar.},

We provide this missing asocial control condition, showing that children can reach the final stage of the puzzlebox without social support. We interpret these findings in the light of current understanding of cumulative culture: there are currently conflicting definitions of cumulative culture, which we argue can lead to drastically different interpretations of (these) experimental results. We conclude that the Dean et al. (Science 335:1114\textendash 1118, 2012) puzzlebox fulfils a process-focused definition, but does not fulfil the (frequently used) product-focused definition.

The Great Famine resulted in a rapid decrease in population size throughout Ireland in a short period of time, increasing the possibility of genetic drift. Our study is based on migration and anthropom\'etrie data collected originally in the 1930s from 7211 adult Irish males. These data were subdivided into three time periods defined by year of birth: 1861\textendash 1880, 1881\textendash 1900, and 1901\textendash 1920. Within each time period the data were further subdivided into six geographic regions of Ireland. Estimates of Wright's FST were calculated from parent-offspring migration data and from 17 anthropom\'etrie variables (10 head measures, 7 body measures). Over time, the average population size decreased, but average rates of migration increased. The estimates of FST at equilibrium from migration matrix analysis suggest that the net effect of these opposite effects is a reduction in among-group variation. Closer examination shows that within each time period the rate of convergence to equilibrium is slow, meaning that the expected levels of genetic homogeneity revealed from migration matrix analysis are not likely to be seen over short intervals of time. Estimates of FST from anthropom\'etrie data show either relatively little change in microdifferentiation or some increase, depending on which variables are analyzed. Investigation of a simple model of demographic and genetic change shows that, given the demographic changes in post-Famine Ireland, FST could in theory increase, decrease, or remain the same over short intervals of time. Overall, the Great Famine appears to have had minimal impact on the genetic structure of Ireland on a regional level. Comparison with studies focusing on local genetic structure shows the opposite. It appears that the level of genetic impact depends strongly on the level of analysis; local populations are affected to a greater extent by demographic shifts than regional populations. We also provide formulas for the standard errors of FST from metric traits and related statistics.},

  abstract = {Phenotypic similarity of species occupying similar habitats has long been taken as strong evidence of adaptation, but this approach implicitly assumes that similarity is evolutionarily derived. However, even derived similarities may not represent convergent adaptation if the similarities did not evolve as a result of the same selection pressures; an alternative possibility is that the similar features evolved for different reasons, but subsequently allowed the species to occupy the same habitat, in which case the convergent evolution of the same feature by species occupying similar habitats would be the result of exaptation. Many lizard lineages have evolved to occupy vertical rock surfaces, a habitat that places strong functional and ecological demands on lizards. We examined four clades in which species that use vertical rock surfaces exhibit long hindlimbs and flattened bodies. Morphological change on the phylogenetic branches leading to the rock-dwelling species in the four clades differed from change on other branches of the phylogeny; evolutionary transitions to rock-dwelling generally were associated with increases in limb length and decreases in head depth. Examination of particular characters revealed several different patterns of evolutionary change. Rock-dwelling lizards exhibited similarities in head depth as a result of both adaptation and exaptation. Moreover, even though rock-dwelling species generally had longer limbs than their close relatives, clade-level differences in limb length led to an overall lack of difference between rock- and non\textendash rock-dwelling lizards. These results indicate that evolutionary change in the same direction in independent lineages does not necessarily produce convergence, and that the existence of similar advantageous structures among species independently occupying the same environment may not indicate adaptation.},

I also show that ignoring phylogeny in preliminary transformations can result in significantly elevated variance and type I error in our statistical estimators, even if subsequent analysis of the transformed data is performed using phylogenetic methods.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Since the end of the Middle Pleistocene (isotopic stages 8 to 6), a clear trend towards laminar production exists in some lithic industries, in northern Europe. This trend expresses itself through non-Levallois direct d\'ebitage (Coquettes, Crayford, etc.) or through Levallois d\'ebitage (Etaples, Biache-Saint-Vaast) and seldom through an Upper Palaeolithic style d\'ebitage (Rissori). The latter really developed in the early stage of the last Glacial Period (isotopic stages 5 and 4) in northern France (Seclin, etc.), in Belgium (Rocourt) and in Germany (Rheindahlen, etc.). Some laminar Levallois industries (Abri du Maras) proved that the Upper Palaeolithic "style" of d\'ebitage does not supplant the other kinds of d\'ebitage. The study of laminar technology during the Middle Palaeolithic in northern Europe shows that the technological "evolution" is made up of a succession of periods of rupture and continuity. The diversity of its technological expressions demonstrates the absence of any chronological meaning of laminar "d\'ebitage".},

  abstract = {Genetic and fossil evidence has accumulated in support of an African origin for modern humans. Despite this consensus, several questions remain with regard to the mode and timing of dispersal out of the continent. Competing models differ primarily by the number of dispersals, their geographic route, and the extent to which expanding modern humans interacted with other hominins. Central in this debate is whether Southeast Asia was occupied significantly earlier than other parts of Eurasia and, if so, whether the population ancestral to extant Southeast Asians was notably different from the ancestors of extant Eurasians. Here, genetic and fossil evidence for the dispersal process out of Africa and into Asia is reviewed. A scenario that can resolve the current archaeological, genetic, and paleontological evidence is one which considers an initial expansion of anatomically modern humans into the Arabian Peninsula and the Levant during the terminal Middle Pleistocene, with continued exchange with Africans until the Late Pleistocene, when modern humans then dispersed into Eurasia in two waves. Advances in population genomics and methods applying evolutionary theory to the fossil record will serve to further clarify modern human origins and the out-of-Africa process.},

However, to date there are no estimates of the rate at which the specific cultural traits of a group disappear, mainly because we lack empirical data to assess how the cultural traits of a given population change over time. Here we estimate changes in cultural traits associated to the traditional knowledge of wild plant uses among an Amazonian indigenous society. We collected data among 1151 Tsimane' Amerindians at two periods of time. Results show that between 2000 and 2009, Tsimane' adults experienced a net decrease in the report of plant uses ranging from 9\% (for the female subsample) to 26\% (for the subsample of people living close to towns), equivalent to a 1 to 3 \% per year. Results from a Monte Carlo simulation show that the observed changes were not the result of randomness. Changes were more acute for men than for women and for informants living in villages close to market towns than for informants settled in remote villages. The Tsimane' could be abandoning their traditional knowledge as they perceive that this form of knowledge do not equip them well to deal with the new socio-economic and cultural conditions they face nowadays.},

Here we contribute to this body of research by presenting three case studies showing evidence of a multistage model of cultural learning in which vertical transmission in childhood loses preeminence toward horizontal and oblique models as subjects' age. The first case study documents and analyzes Baka children's daily activities (southeast Cameroon) in an attempt to understand (1) how time investments might affect the acquisition of knowledge and (2) the importance of scaffolding on knowledge acquisition. Building on this idea, the second case study explores the transmission of knowledge through the life cycle, documenting the accumulation of knowledge required for collecting wild honey among children and adults from a Jenu Kuruba tribal community in South India. The last case study uses data from the Tsimane' (Bolivian Amazon) to analyze the correspondence between levels of adult knowledge and the knowledge of (a) the same-sex parent, (b) age peers, and (c) parental cohort. Results from this study suggest that \textendash{} at adulthood \textendash{} cultural knowledge is most likely a mix of information gathered from a variety of sources. Overall, the three case studies give evidence to support the multistage learning model for cultural transmission but also emphasize the importance of social learning during childhood, a period during which individuals acquire the baseline knowledge that allow the latter development of complex skills through scaffolding and the integration of information from multiple models.},

With the predominant focus on their morphological attributes and technological aspects of manufacture, stone artifacts and their assemblages have been analyzed as explicit measures of past behaviors, adaptations, and population histories. This analytical focus on technological and morphological appearance is one of the characteristics of the conventional approach for constructing inferences from this record. An equally persistent routine involves ascribing the emerged patterns and variability within the archaeological deposits directly to long-term central tendencies in human actions and cultural transmission. Here we re-evaluate this conventional approach. By invoking some of the known concerns and concepts about the formation of archaeological record, we introduce notions of aggregates and formational emergence to expand on the understanding of how artifacts accumulate, what these accumulations represent, and how the patterns and variability among them emerge. To infer behavior that could inform on past lifeways, we further promote a shift in the focus of analysis from the technological and morphological appearance of artifacts and assemblages to the practice of stone use. We argue for a more rigorous and multi-level inferential procedure in modeling behavioral adaptation and evolution.},

  abstract = {Temporal variability in flaking stone has been used as one of the currencies for hominin behavioural and biological evolution. This variability is usually traced through changes in artefact forms and techniques of production, resulting overall in unilineal and normative models of hominin adaptation. Here, we focus on the fundamental purpose of flaking stone\textemdash the production of a sharp working edge\textemdash and model this behaviour over evolutionary time to reassess the evolutionary efficiency of stone tool technology. Using more than 18,000 flakes from 81 assemblages spanning two million years, we show that greater production of sharp edges was followed by increased variability in this behaviour. We propose that a diachronic increase in this variability was related to a higher intensity of interrelations between different behaviours involving the use and management of stone resources that gave fitness advantages in particular environmental contexts. The long-term trends identified in this study inform us that the evolutionary efficiency of stone tool technology was not inherently in advanced tool forms and production techniques, but emerged within the contingencies of hominin interaction with local environments.},

  abstract = {Constraints are factors that limit evolutionary change. A subset of constraints is developmental, and acts during embryonic development. There is some uncertainty about how to define developmental constraints, and how to formulate them as testable hypotheses. Furthermore, concepts such as constraint-breaking, universal constraints, and forbidden morphologies present some conceptual difficulties. One of our aims is to clarify these issues. After briefly reviewing current classifications of constraint, we define developmental constraints as those affecting morphogenetic processes in ontogeny. They may be generative or selective, although a clear distinction cannot always be drawn. We support the idea that statements about constraints are in fact statements about the relative frequency of particular transformations (where `transformation' indicates a change from the ancestral condition). An important consequence of this is that the same transformation may be constrained in one developmental or phylogenetic context, but evolutionarily plastic in another. In this paper, we analyse developmental constraints within a phylogenetic framework, building on similar work by previous authors. Our approach is based on the following assumptions from the literature: (1) constraints are identified when there is a discrepancy between the observed frequency of a transformation, and its expected frequency; (2) the `expected' distribution is derived by examining the phylogenetic distribution of the transformation and its associated selection pressures. Thus, by looking for congruence between these various phylogenetic distribution patterns, we can test hypotheses about constraint. We critically examine this approach using a test case: variation in phalanx-number in the amniote limb. J. Exp. Zool. (Mol. Dev. Evol.) 296B:8\textendash 22, 2003. r 2003 WileyLiss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Humans evolved from an ape ancestor that was highly intelligent, moderately social and moderately dependent on cultural adaptations for subsistence technology (tools). By the late Pleistocene, humans had become highly dependent on culture for subsistence and for rules to organize a complex social life. Adaptation by cultural traditions transformed our life history, leading to an extended juvenile period to learn subsistence and social skills, post-reproductive survival to help conserve and transmit skills, a dependence on social support for mothers of large-brained, very dependent and nutrient-demanding offspring, males devoting substantial effort to provisioning rather than mating, and the cultivation of large social networks to tap pools in information unavailable to less social species. One measure of the success of the exploitation of culture is that the minimum inter-birth interval of humans is nearly half that of our ape relatives. Another measure is the wide geographical distribution of humans compared with other apes, based on subsistence systems adapted to fine-scale spatial environmental variation. An important macro-evolutionary question is why our big-brained, culture-intensive life-history strategy evolved so recently and in only our lineage. We suggest that increasing spatial and temporal variation in the Pleistocene favoured cultural adaptations.This article is part of the theme issue `Life history and learning: how childhood, caregiving and old age shape cognition and culture in humans and other animals'.},

Given the high density of material accumulated over a relatively short time span, we show that Kharaneh IV was an aggregation site occupied intensively by a significant number of people, providing new perspectives on the east Jordanian phenomenon of Epipalaeolithic `mega-sites'.},

Building on this work, this paper presents evidence that the large, but so far largely ignored eruption of the Laacher See-volcano, located in present-day western Germany and dated to 12,920 BP, had a dramatic impact on forager demography all along the northern periphery of Late Glacial settlement and precipitated archaeologically visible cultural change. In Southern Scandinavia, these changes took the form of technological simplification, the loss of bow-and-arrow technology, and coincident with these changes, the emergence of the regionally distinct Bromme culture. Groups in north-eastern Europe appear to have responded to the eruption in similar ways, but on the British Isles and in the Thuringian Basin populations contracted or relocated, leaving these areas largely depopulated already before the onset of the Younger Dryas/GS-1 cooling. Demographic models are used to link these changes to the Laacher See-eruption and this research demonstrates that we cannot sideline catastrophic environmental change in our reconstructions of prehistoric culture history.},

Fundamentally, there is an urgent need to reconcile archaeological and genetic taxonomies. However, traditional archaeological taxonomies are problematic because they are epistemologically weak and often laden with undue assumptions about past ethnicity and demography\textemdash they are a hindrance rather than a help in such a reconciliation. Eisenmann and colleagues have recently tackled this issue, offering a palette of potential solutions that circumvents traditional archaeological culture labels. We welcome renewed attention to nomenclature but take issue with such recent work that favours systems of taxonomic assignment for genomic groups that either do not include archaeological information at all or retain traditional cultural taxonomic categories. While superficially pragmatic, these administrative solutions do not address the substantive issues that the topic raises. We here present the argument that the only analytically viable solution to aligning genetic and cultural nomenclature is to conceptualise material culture as underwritten by a system of information transmission across generations that has similar structural properties to the genetic system of information transmission. This alignment facilitates the use of similar analytical protocols and hence allows for a true parallel analysis. Once culture change is also understood as an evolutionary process, a wealth of analytical methods for reconciling archaeological and genetic clusters becomes available.},

Whilst detailed natural scientific knowledge of a given event is critical in understanding its impacts, an equally thorough understanding of the affected communities, their economies, ecologies, religious structures, and how all of these have developed over time is arguably as important. Many extreme events leave methodologically convenient traces in the geological and archaeological records in the form of discrete stratigraphic layers often associated with both accurate and precise dates. This paper focuses on volcanic eruptions and draws on matched case studies to illustrate the usefulness of a two-step, quasi case\textendash control comparative method for examining vulnerability and impacts in the near- and far-fields of these eruptions. Although issues of data resolution often plague the study of past disasters, these limitations are counterbalanced by the access to unique long-term information on societies and their material expressions of livelihood, as well as a similarly long-term perspective on the critical magnitude/frequency relationship of the geophysical trigger(s) in question. By drawing together aspects of contemporary Disaster Risk Reduction research, archaeology, and volcanology, this paper sketches out a methodological roadmap for a science of past disasters that aims to be relevant for not only understanding vulnerabilities and impacts in the deep past, but for also better understanding vulnerability in the present.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new methodology to study prehistoric lithic assemblages in an attempt to derive from that facet of prehistoric behavior the greater technoeconomic system in which it was embedded. By using volumetric artifact density and the frequency of retouched pieces within a given lithic assemblage, it becomes possible to identify whether these stone tools were created by residentially mobile or logistically organized foragers. The linking factor between assemblage composition and land-use strategy is that of curation within lithic assemblages as an expression of economizing behavior. This method is used to study eight sites from southeastern Italy to detect changes in adaptation during the Late Pleistocene. We compare and contrast Mousterian, Uluzzian, proto-Aurignacian and Epigravettian assemblages, and argue that the first three industries overlap considerably in terms of their technoeconomic flexibility. Epigravettian assemblages, on the other hand, display a different kind of land-use exploitation pattern than those seen in the earlier assemblages, perhaps as a response to deteriorating climatic conditions at the Last Glacial Maximum. While we discuss the implications of these patterns in the context of modern human origins, we argue that the methodology can help identify land-use patterns in other locales and periods.

            Resumen
            Nous proposons une nouvelle approche pour l'\'etude des ensembles lithiques permettant d'identifier les syst\`emes techno-\'economiques dans lesquels ils s'ins\`erent. Utilisant comme param\`etres analytiques la densit\'e volum\'etrique d'art\`efacts et le rapport outils/d\'ebitage, il devient possible d'attribuer un ensemble lithique pr\'ehistorique \`a un mode d'organisation \guillemotleft{} logistique \guillemotright{} ou \guillemotleft{} \`a mobilit\'e r\'esidentielle \guillemotright. Le degr\'e de \guillemotleft{} conservation \"e au sein d'un ensemble lithique, interpr\'et\'e comme l'expression variable d'une attitude \'econome vis-\`a-vis de la mati\`ere premi\`ere, constitue le lien entre la composition d'un ensemble lithique et un mode pr\'ef\'erentiel d'exploitation du territoire. Nous appliquons notre m\'ethodologie \`a l'\'etude de huit sites de l'Italie m\'eridionale remontant au Pl\'eistoc\`ene sup\'erieur. En comparant les r\'esultats tir\'es d'ensembles moust\'eriens, uluzziens, proto-aurignaciens et \'epigravettiens, nous constatons que les trois premi\`eres industries semblent caract\'eris\'ees par une similarit\'e marqu\'ee en ce qui a trait \`a leur flexibilit\'e techno-\'economique alors que l'\'Epigravettien appara\^it d\'efini par un mod\`ele distinct d'exploitation du territoire, repr\'esentant vraisemblablement une adaptation aux climats plus rudes du dernier maximum glaciaire. Nous interpr\'etons les r\'esultats de cette approche dans le contexte de l'origine de l'homme moderne, mais soulignons que cette m\'ethodologie peut aussi permettre d'identifier les mod\`eles d'exploitation du territoire dans les sites stratifi\'es d'autres p\'eriodes et r\'egions.},

This conclusion is strikingly convergent with recent estimates for the colonization of remote East Polynesia. Our analysis highlights the need for wood charcoal identification to insure selection of short-lived plants/plant parts for radiocarbon dating, and that a reliance on dating unidentified wood charcoal is a waste of resources that only serves to retard progress in refining the settlement chronology of Hawai'i Island and other locations.},

Towards that end, in this paper we compile the available radiocarbon dates from published and unpublished (``grey literature'') sources. We critically evaluate 236 radiocarbon dates following a chronometric hygiene protocol to identify the most secure and reliable age estimates. We accept 147 dates (62.3\%) as a means of addressing two significant issues for S amoan prehistory: (1) the chronology of settlement and human expansion across the archipelago pre-2000 cal BP, which relates to issues of Lapita colonization, and the effect of island geomorphology on settlement; and (2) analysis of the so-called ``Dark Ages'' (ca. 1500e 1000 cal BP), a period relevant to issues of social complexity and East Polynesian settlement.

Dated to the end of the regional Middle Paleolithic, this level has also yielded a small lithic assemblage abandoned by Neandertals in a small number of occupations at the site. This assemblage is characterized by its microlithic nature. The microlithic blanks and tools were obtained from Levallois, Discoid and blade productions using a combination of local, distant and very distant flints. How the technology was managed at El Cuco indicates that it served to supply tools to a Neandertal group with high residential mobility that exploited a broad spectrum of resources, including shellfish. We interpret this as further evidence of Neandertal population decrease in the region after 50,000 BP, probably driven by a shortage of resources, that ultimately led to the untangling of social networks and to their temporary disappearance from the Cantabrian Region.},

These sites represent the first intensive survey and excavation program in this part of Fiji. The sites are a cave (Matanigaga), which acted as a short-term shelter, and a ring-wall mound (Drautana), one of a number of similar sites interpreted as likely precursors to complex ridge-top fortifications. Both sites suggest that occupation in this area began in the last millennium and involved exploitation of near shore marine resources. The number of fortified hilltops on the Vatia Peninsula suggests that conflict may have been endemic in this area of Fiji during the latter part of the last millennium. Site descriptions and the analysis of ceramic, lithic, and mollusk remains are presented here.},

The discovery, within the international research programme Palaeoenvironment and human settlement in West Africa, of an impressive Pleistocene sedimentary sequence with numerous archaeological levels in the sector of Ounjougou (Dogon Country, Mali), is thus of great importance, insofar as it allows us to set up a first chrono-cultural reference framework for the West African Palaeolithic. Although the exact chronological position of a Lower Palaeolithic human settlement has yet to be specified, the recurrent Middle Palaeolithic occupation, between the end of marine isotope stage 5 and the beginning of stage 2, reveals an astonishing cultural diversity. This could indicate an important repopulating activity, following climatic and environmental changes during the Upper Pleistocene. Particularly, the appearance of the Levallois reduction technique in Sahelian West Africa, possibly prior to the emergence of the Saharan Aterian, leads us to reconsider the question of the origin of this reduction concept introduction in sub-Saharan West Africa. More generally, the Palaeolithic sequence in the sector of Ounjougou shows the intrusion of more southern and/or eastern cultural influences.},

The results of this survey identified two areas that merited further investigation, and area excavations were carried out at Quarry 2/C and Quarry 2/D in 1990 and 1991 respectively. These concentrated on the main Pleistocene landsurface (Unit 4c) and revealed spreads of knapping debris associated with the production of flint handaxes. Two test pits and area Q2/C produced handaxes, over 90\% of which had tranchet sharpening at the distal end. A small amount of core reduction and only a few flake tools were found: these were all from Quarry 2/C. Faunal remains were located in the northern part of the excavations where Unit 4c had a calcareous cover.

The excavated areas are interpreted as a tool-sharpening and butchery site that may have been a fixed and known locale in the landscape (Q2/C), and a location on the periphery of an area of intensive knapping reduction (Q2/D). Sedimentological and microfaunal analyses demonstrate that Unit 4c was formed as a soil in the top of a marine-lagoonal silt, the pedogenic processes being similar to those observed after draining Dutch polder lakes. The palaeoenvironment is interpreted as an area of open grassland with some shrub and bush vegetation. In places the surface of the soil supported small ephemeral pools and flashes. This area of grassland is seen as a corridor for herds of ungulates moving east and west between the sea to the south and the relict cliff and wooded downland block to the north.

  abstract = {East Africa has produced the earliest record of Homo sapiens\textasciitilde 200ka and a punctuated record of Middle Stone Age and Later Stone Age behaviors. We lack, however, a detailed late Quaternary paleoenvironmental record for the region, particularly during humid periods. Without a regional record, hypotheses about the evolution and ecology of early Homo sapiens in East Africa remain vague and untestable. The Kibish Formation of southern Ethiopia presents a long, albeit punctuated, record of late Middle Pleistocene to Holocene faunal change in East Africa, which was deposited during humid periods. Here, we present oxygen and carbon stable isotope data of the Kibish ungulates and test whether there are environmental changes within the Kibish Formation. Significant differences in {$\delta$}18O enamel isotopes are consistent with more humid conditions during the Holocene-age Member IV (\textasciitilde 13\textendash 4ka) than either Pleistocene-age Member I (\textasciitilde 196ka) or Member III (\textasciitilde 104ka). Mesowear data document a shift toward more attritional wear among grazers in Member IV and are correlated with more depleted {$\delta$}18O enamel values, suggesting that the wear pattern shift is linked to the onset of more humid conditions during the Holocene. {$\delta$}13C enamel values show subtle variations through time, but do not suggest any major changes in diets. We propose that the paleoenvironmental differences evident in Member IV, based on {$\delta$}18O enamel values, mesowear, and bovid abundances, may be explained by cooler and wetter conditions at the beginning of the Holocene in the lower Omo Valley. The evidence suggesting that the Holocene humid phase is more pronounced than earlier humid phases may explain why arid-adapted grassland ungulates became extinct in East Africa by the Pleistocene\textendash Holocene transition, but persisted through previous humid phases of the late Quaternary.},

  abstract = {In this review we attempt to reconstruct the evolutionary history of hominin life history from extant and fossil evidence. We utilize demographic life history theory and distinguish life history variables, traits such as weaning, age at sexual maturity, and life span, from life history-related variables such as body mass, brain growth, and dental development. The latter are either linked with, or can be used to make inferences about, life history, thus providing an opportunity for estimating life history parameters in fossil taxa. We compare the life history variables of modern great apes and identify traits that are likely to be shared by the last common ancestor of Pan-Homo and those likely to be derived in hominins. All great apes exhibit slow life histories and we infer this to be true of the last common ancestor of Pan-Homo and the stem hominin. Modern human life histories are even slower, exhibiting distinctively long post-menopausal life spans and later ages at maturity, pointing to a reduction in adult mortality since the Pan-Homo split. We suggest that lower adult mortality, distinctively short interbirth intervals, and early weaning characteristic of modern humans are derived features resulting from cooperative breeding. We evaluate the fidelity of three life history-related variables, body mass, brain growth and dental development, with the life history parameters of living great apes. We found that body mass is the best predictor of great ape life history events. Brain growth trajectories and dental development and eruption are weakly related proxies and inferences from them should be made with caution. We evaluate the evidence of life history-related variables available for extinct species and find that prior to the transitional hominins there is no evidence of any hominin taxon possessing a body size, brain size or aspects of dental development much different from what we assume to be the primitive life history pattern for the Pan-Homo clade. Data for life history-related variables among the transitional hominin grade are consistent and none agrees with a modern human pattern. Aside from mean body mass, adult brain size, crown and root formation times, and the timing and sequence of dental eruption of Homo erectus are inconsistent with that of modern humans. Homo antecessor fossil material suggests a brain size similar to that of Homo erectus s. s., and crown formation times that are not yet modern, though there is some evidence of modern human-like timing of tooth formation and eruption. The body sizes, brain sizes, and dental development of Homo heidelbergensis and Homo neanderthalensis are consistent with a modern human life history but samples are too small to be certain that they have life histories within the modern human range. As more life history-related variable information for hominin species accumulates we are discovering that they can also have distinctive life histories that do not conform to any living model. At least one extinct hominin subclade, Paranthropus, has a pattern of dental life history-related variables that most likely set it apart from the life histories of both modern humans and chimpanzees.},

These instruments were employed to work rocks in several ways (working in quarries, excavating mine galleries and other enclosures, manufacturing tools, etc.). The artifacts were recovered in the excavation of a quarry for the production of rotator milling stones (Monta\~na Quemada, Gran Canaria). In the quarries intensive productive processes were developed, where picks were submitted to strong mechanical and frictional stresses, which caused frequent accidents requiring continuous repairs. These circumstances made it necessary to develop a type of artifact with technical features that allowed reshaping and resharpening tasks in order to extend its active life. A combination of morphotechnical and functional studies, along with the refitting results, have enabled us to reconstruct their knapping and use strategies, showing a high level of skill. In addition, this analysis has involved defining, for the first time, the different categories of byproducts generated during the process of the configuration and reconfiguration of the picks. Their detailed description will make it possible to recognize them in other archaeological contexts.},

The pattern of the presence and absence of hominins through time, and the implications for their survival skills, have been the focus of considerable research. Here, we take the relatively rich late Middle Palaeolithic record from northern France as a starting point for examining the demographic processes underlying hiatuses in the Palaeolithic record. What did this involve in terms of changes in the distribution and abundance of Neandertal populations, and interactions between populations, during the glacial\textendash interglacial cycles? Definitions in the ecological literature of terms such as `refugia' and research on the nature of population responses to Pleistocene climatic fluctuations may be helpful in posing this and other questions regarding human evolution. Current understanding of Neandertal ecology and comparative data support the argument that rather than tracking preferred habitats, northern populations of Neandertals suffered local extinctions. The archaeological record and genetic studies of Neandertals and carnivore species potentially provide information relevant to this hypothesis, but interpreting this evidence is challenging. This process of repeated regional extinction would have been an important factor in the demography of hominin populations, and may have been at the root of the development of the Neandertal lineage.},

Here we test the hypothesis that these features evolved in the context of making and using stone tools, specifically for producing large gripping forces and for countering large joint contact stresses. We used portable force plates simulating early stone tools to: 1) document and compare the magnitude of external/internal forces and joint stresses in the radial digits during hardhammer percussion and flake use, and 2) examine how variation in digit morphology affects muscle and joint mechanics during stone tool use. Force and kinematic data were collected from a sample representing normal variation in digit morphology (n~=~25). The effects of digit size/shape on digit biomechanics were evaluated using partial correlations, controlling for tool reaction forces and impact velocities. Results show that individuals with longer digits require relatively less muscle force to stabilize digital joints, and are exposed to relatively lower joint contact stresses during stone tool use, due in part to an increase in the robusticity of metacarpals and phalanges in humans relative to chimpanzees. These analyses further suggest that Pan- or australopith-like pollical anatomy presents serious performance challenges to habitual tool use. Our data support the hypothesis that evolutionary increases in thumb length, robusticity, and thenar muscle mass enabled Homo to produce more force and to tolerate higher joint stresses during tool use.},

The production of pigment art and engravings at the shelter appears to have begun by c. 13,000 BP and indicates a growing concern by people with using graphic art to record their relationship with the site. Over the last millennium changes in the surviving frieze of paintings at Puritjarra record fundamental changes in graphic vocabulary, style, and composition of the paintings. These coincide with other evidence for changes in the geographic linkages of the site. As Puritjarra's place in the social geography changed, the motifs appropriate for the site also changed. The history of this rock shelter shows that detailed site histories will be required if we are to disentangle the development of central Australian graphic systems from the temporal and spatial variability inherent in the expression of these systems.

            R\'esum\'e
            Les relations complexes, et officiellement reconnues par la religion, entre peuples et lieux sont l'un des aspects les plus distinctifs de l'Australie aborig\`ene. Dans le d\'esert australien, les peintures et gravures pari\'etales nous fournissent un lien tangible avec la g\'eographie totemique et nous permettent d'examiner \`a la fois les changements dans le r\^ole de lieux individuels et aussi dans le d\'eveloppement de ce syst\`eme de relations avec la terre. Dans cette \'etude, nous utilisons l'art pari\'etal pour examiner les changements dans l'histoire de l'abri sous roche de Puritjarra dans l'ouest de l'Australie Centrale. La production d'art pigment\'e et de gravures dans l'abri semble avoir commenc\'e avant environ 13 000 B.P. et t\'emoigne d'un souci grandissant chez ces peuples pour l'utilisation de l'art graphique afin de rendre compte de leurs relations avec le site. Au cours du dernier mill\'enaire, les changements dans la frise de peintures qui a surv\'ecu \`a Puritjarra t\'emoigne de changements fondamentaux en mati\`ere de vocabulaire, style et composition graphiques.de ces peintures. Ils co\"incident avec d'autres t\'emoignages de changements dans les liens g\'eographiques du site. Au fur et \`a mesure que changeait la place de Puritjarra dans la g\'eographie sociale, changeai\=ent \'egalement les motifs appropri\'es au site. L'histoire de cet abri sous roche montre que nous aurons besoin d'histoires d\'etaill\'ees des sites si nous devons isoler le d\'eveloppement des syst\`emes graphiques d'Australie Centrale de la variabilit\'e temporelle et spatiale inh\'erente \`a l'expression de ces syst\`emes.

            Res\'umen
            Una de las caracter\'isticas m\'as distintivas de la Australia aborigen son las relaciones elaboradas y religiosamente sancionadas entre gente y lugar. En el desierto australiano, las pinturas y grabados rupestres proporcionan un v\'inculo tangible con la geograf\'ia tot\'emica y nos permiten examinar tanto los cambios en el papel de los sitios individuales como el desarrollo de este sistema de relaci\'on con la tierra. En este trabajo utilizamos el arte parietal para examinar la cambiante historia del refugio de Puritjarra, en Australia centro-occidental. La producci\'on de arte pintado y de grabados en el refugio parece haber comenzado alrededor de 13,000 BP e indica la creciente preocupaci\'on en los grupos humanos que utilizaron el refugio con el uso de arte gr\'afico para inmortalizar su relaci\'on con el sitio. A lo largo del \'ultimo milenio, cambios en el conjunto de pinturas que han sobrevivido en Puritjarra reflejan cambios fundamentales en el vocabulario gr\'afico, estilo y composici\'on de dichas pinturas. Estos coinciden con otra evidencia de cambios en los v\'inculos geogr\'aficos del sitio. Seg\'un fue cambiando la importancia del refugio de Puritjarra en la geograf\'ia social, fueron cambiando tambi\'en los motivos adecuados al sitio. La historia de este refugio demuestra que historias detalladas de cada yacimiento van a ser necesarias para poder desenmara\~nar el desarrollo de los sitemas gr\'aficos de Australia central, de la variabilidad temporal y espacial que es inherente a la expresi\'on de estos sistemas.

            Zusammenfassung
            Elaborierte, religi\"os sanktionierte Beziehungen zwischen Mensch und Ort geh\"oren zu den deutlichsten Merkmalen im Australien der Aborigines. In der australischen W\"uste bilden Felsmalereien und -gravuren eine greifbare Verbindung zur totemistischen Geographie und erlauben die Untersuchung sowohl von Ver\"anderungen der Rolle individueller Orte als auch von Entwicklungen dieser Mensch-Raum-Beziehungen. In diesem Beitrag dient die Felskunst der Untersuchung der wechselnden Geschichte des Puritjarra Felsabris in Westzentralaustralien. Die Produktion von Pigmentkunst und Gravuren an diesem Abris scheint um 13.000 BP aufgenommen worden zu sein und deutet die wachsende Besch\"aftigung der Menschen mit der Nutzung graphischer Kunst f\"ur die Aufzeichnung ihrer Beziehungen zu diesem Ort an. W\"ahrend des letzten Jahrtausends dokumentieren Ver\"anderungen im \"uberlebenden Bildfries von Puritjarra fundamentale Ver\"anderungen im graphischen Vokabular, Stil und in der Komposition der Bilder. Diese stimmen mit anderen Hinweisen f\"ur Ver\"anderungen in den geographischen Verbindungen dieses Ortes \"uberein. Die Geschichte dieses Felsabris zeigt, dass eine detaillierte Geschichte jedes Fundplatzes notwendig ist, wenn wir die Entwicklung zentralaustralischer graphischer Systeme aus der zeitlichen und r\"aumlichen Variabilit\"at ihrer Ausdrucksformen herauskristallisieren wollen.},

Two optically stimulated luminescence age estimates from the open-air site of Aybut Al Auwal in Oman place the Arabian Nubian Complex at {$\sim$}106,000 years ago, providing archaeological evidence for the presence of a distinct northeast African Middle Stone Age technocomplex in southern Arabia sometime in the first half of Marine Isotope Stage 5.},

While archaeological research has established that the communities of SE Arabia participated in a widespread Bronze Age exchange system that included areas of the ancient Near East, South Asia, and Central Asia, it is unclear to what degree this interaction fostered the broad-scale socioeconomic changes seen in the Early Bronze Age of SE Arabia. Here we present the results of an agent-based model that suggest the nature of the internal exchange economy in SE Arabia itself may have precipitated the social conditions necessary for change by allowing individuals to profit disproportionately. We thus emphasize the importance of local production strategies in generating socioeconomic change, in addition to the well-established economic and cultural contacts with the wider Bronze Age world.},

Since then, the Cha\^telperronian has generally been considered a ``transitional'' industry rather than an Upper or a Middle Paleolithic industry because of its chronological position, and the association of Neanderthal remains with blades, bone tools and personal ornaments. Several competing hypotheses have been proposed to explain the association between Neanderthals and these types of artefacts including postdepositional mixing, acculturation from anatomically modern human populations, or an independent technological evolution by local Neanderthal populations. Quin\c{c}ay Cave is the only Cha\^telperronian site where personal ornaments have been found that does not contain an overlying Upper Paleolithic layer. This means that the post-depositional mixing of later elements into the Ch\^atelperronian may not be used as an explanation for the presence of these materials. We report here on a detailed technological analysis of lithic artefacts from the three Cha\^telperronian layers at Quin\c{c}ay Cave. We compare our results with the technology of Mousterian blade industries dating to OIS (oxygen isotope stage) 5, the Mousterian of Acheulian Tradition type B, and the Proto-Aurignacian. We show that the Cha\^telperronian is sufficiently divergent from the Middle Paleolithic to be classified as a fully Upper Paleolithic industry, with a focus on blade and bladelet production. We also show that the Quin\c{c}ay Cha\^telperronian includes retouched bladelets that resemble those found in the Proto-Aurignacian, but were produced in a different manner. We argue that a technological convergence cannot account for these behaviors, since the specific type of retouched bladelet associated with the Cha\^telperronian was also regularly used by Proto-Aurignacian of neighboring regions. We suggest that the idea of retouched bladelets may have diffused from the northern Proto-Aurignacian to the Quin\c{c}ay Cha\^telperronian and that the transmission of the morphology of this desired end-product without the transmission of its manufacturing process may point toward a low degree of social intimacy between these groups. We conclude that the apparent paradox of the Cha\^telperronian is the result of the complexity of interaction between Neanderthal and anatomically modern human groups in western Europe between 45,000 and 40,000 years ago.},

  abstract = {The ongoing refinement of archaeological excavation and recording methods over the last decades has led to a significant increase in quantitative Middle Palaeolithic datasets that provide a record of past Neanderthal behaviour. Stone tools and butchered animal remains are the two main categories of Middle Palaeolithic archaeological remains and both provide distinctive insights into site formation and Neanderthal behaviour. However, the integration of these quantitative lithic and zooarchaeological datasets is key for achieving a full understanding of both site-specific and broader-scale patterns of Middle Palaeolithic subsistence. To explore novel ways to enhance the incorporation of these datasets, we organised a session at the 82nd annual meeting of the Society for American Archaeology in Vancouver. An underlying theme was the problem of linking lithic and faunal variability. Are variations in subsistence strategies reflected by changes in toolmaking decisions? This paper will briefly introduce the possible ways these Middle Palaeolithic datasets can be integrated, illustrated with the papers included in this special volume, and discuss its potential for understanding the variability and interconnectedness of Neanderthal technologies and subsistence strategies.},

The late Middle Palaeolithic (MIS 5d-3, ca. 115,000e35,000 BP [years before present]) permits a novel, data-driven assessment of these concepts through a unique record: bifacial tools made by classic Neanderthals. Previously, studies of late Middle Palaeolithic bifacial tools were hampered by a convoluted plethora of competing terms, types and regional entities. This paper presents a large-scale intercomparison of this tool type, and bridges typotechnological and spatio-temporal data from across Western Europe (Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany).},

  abstract = {Discovery of the first complete Early Pleistocene hominin pelvis, Gona BSN49/P27, attributed to Homo erectus, raises a number of issues regarding early hominin body size and shape variation. Here, acetabular breadth, femoral head breadth, and body mass calculated from femoral head breadth are compared in 37 early hominin (6.0\textendash 0.26 Ma) specimens, including BSN49/P27. Acetabular and estimated femoral head sizes in the Gona specimen fall close to the means for non-Homo specimens (Orrorin tugenesis, Australopithecus africanus, Paranthropus robustus), and well below the ranges of all previously described Early and Middle Pleistocene Homo specimens. The Gona specimen has an estimated body mass of 33.2 kg, close to the mean for the non-Homo sample (34.1 kg, range 24\textendash 51.5 kg, n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 19) and far outside the range for any previously known Homo specimen (mean {$\frac{1}{4}$} 70.5 kg; range 52\textendash 82 kg, n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 17). Inclusion of the Gona specimen within H. erectus increases inferred sexual dimorphism in body mass in this taxon to a level greater than that observed here for any other hominin taxon, and increases variation in body mass within H. erectus females to a level much greater than that observed for any living primate species. This raises questions regarding the taxonomic attribution of the Gona specimen. When considered within the context of overall variation in body breadth among early hominins, the mediolaterally very wide Gona pelvis fits within the distribution of other lower latitude Early and Middle Pleistocene specimens, and below that of higher latitude specimens. Thus, ecogeographic variation in body breadth was present among earlier hominins as it is in living humans. The increased M-L pelvic breadth in all earlier hominins relative to modern humans is related to an increase in ellipticity of the birth canal, possibly as a result of a nonrotational birth mechanism that was common to both australopithecines and archaic Homo.},

  abstract = {Easter Island deforestation has traditionally been viewed as an abrupt island-wide event caused by the prehistoric Rapanui civilization, which precipitated its own cultural collapse. This view emerges from earlier paleoecological analyses of lake sediments showing a sudden and total replacement of palm by grass pollen shortly after Polynesian settlement (800-1200 CE). However, further paleoecological research has challenged this view showing that the apparent abruptness and island-wide synchroneity of forest removal was an artifact due to the occurrence of a sedimentary gap of several millennia that prevented a detailed record the replacement of palm-dominated forests by grass meadows. During the last decade, several continuous and chronological coherent sediment cores encompassing the last millennia have been retrieved and analyzed, showing a very different picture. According to these analyses, deforestation was not abrupt but gradual and took place at different times and at different rates, depending on the site. Regarding causes, humans were not the only responsible for forest clearing as climatic droughts, as well as climatehuman-landscape feedbacks and synergies, also played a role. In summary, the deforestation of Easter Island was a complex process, heterogeneous in time and space, which took place under the action of both natural and anthropogenic drivers and their interactions. In addition, archaeological evidence shows that the Rapanui civilization was resilient to deforestation and remained healthy until European contact, which contradicts the occurrence of a cultural collapse. Further research should be aimed at obtaining new continuous cores and make use of recently developed biomarker analyses to advance towards a holistic view of the patterns, causes and consequences of Easter Island deforestation.},

Currently, the best-known skeletal evidence for the earliest anatomically modern Homo sapiens (AMHs) derives from sites in the rift valley in Ethiopia. However, archaeological evidence from cave sites in southern and northern Africa largely dominates discussions on behaviors that characterize the dawn of modern humans. Later Middle Pleistocene open-air sites in East Africa present unparalleled geochronological control and thus a better chance to study hominin behavior. Here, we present results of a multidisciplinary investigation of the archaeology and geochronology of one of the oldest-known Middle Stone Age (MSA) occupations from the Gademotta Formation (Fm.) in the Main Ethiopian Rift. Renewed excavation, lithic analysis, fracture mechanics, and tephrochronological investigations at Gademotta provide a better understanding of the chronological and behavioral contexts during the critical period immediately preceding the origin of our species.},

Here we announce and describe the latest addition to the roster of hominid-bearing research areas in this basin. Located east of the modern Awash River and west of the Megenta mountain ridge, localities in the new research area contain extensive clay and silty-sand deposits variably capped by a widespread sandstone layer rich in archaeology and vertebrate fossils. Some of the localities are associated with volcanic tuffs suitable for radioisotopic age determination. A Middle Pleistocene antiquity is strongly inferred from the sampled fauna and archaeology; precise age estimates await results from ongoing tephra geochronological and geochemical analyses. Much of the archaeology falls under the conventional category of late Acheulean; assemblages identifiable as `Middle' and `Later Stone Age' are documented in a few localities. The vertebrate fauna from the closely probed Acheulean and hominid-bearing localities indicates a relatively wooded, near-water habitat. The cranial and postcranial fossil hominid (and faunal) remains from the new localities promise insights into the patterns of human evolution across the Middle Pleistocene, a period currently poorly understood. Similarly, the archaeological occurrences provide unique opportunities for testing outstanding hypotheses about the origin of nuanced technologies and behaviors across the later Middle Pleistocene.},

Their analysis of selected assemblages from three of the 1972 excavations expands the original typo-technological interpretations by Wendorf and Schild (1974). We particularly welcome their evaluation of our recent inferences about the function of pointed artifacts and technological patterns in the Gademotta Fm. (Sahle et al., 2013, 2014). However, we find several arguments and conclusions in Douze and Delagnes (2016) to be rather unconvincing and irreconcilable with results from analyses of whole assemblages (Wendorf and Schild, 1974; Sahle et al., 2013, 2014). Specifically, their summary attribution of all early MSA burin-like fractures on the distal tips of pointed artifacts to intentional resharpening blows, and their use of this pattern as a technological ``chrono-marker'' unique to the region are untenable. Here, we highlight these issues in the hopes of a clearer understanding of the evident technological patterns in the Gademotta Fm.},

The recent discoveries of sites yielding hominid remains and/or early industries in Africa and Eurasia reveal that early hominid expansion into the temperate regions of the Old World occurred earlier than it was commonly assumed. North Africa is likely the area which early hominids inhabited before their spread out of the African continent. Therefore, it is pertinent to approach the issue of the earliest human presence in this part of Africa. Ain Hanech is a key site to shed light on this issue. Comprising several localities, the site is dated to 1.78 Ma based upon palaeomagnetic and biochronological data. The recent excavations yielded a savannah PlioPleistocene fauna associated with Oldowan assemblages deposited in a floodplain environment. The Ain Hanech investigations point out to a very ancient human presence in North Africa, thus contrasting with the short chronology model proposed by some researchers. To cite this article: M.

However, transmission chain experiments in human and non-human primates suggest that cumulative cultural evolution (CCE) might not necessarily depend on high-fidelity copying after all. In this study, we test whether defining properties of CCE can emerge in a non-copying task. We performed transmission chain experiments in Guinea baboons and human children where individuals observed and produced visual patterns composed of four squares on touchscreen devices. In order to be rewarded, participants had to avoid touching squares that were touched by a previous participant. In other words, they were rewarded for innovation rather than copying. Results nevertheless exhibited fundamental properties of CCE: an increase over generations in task performance and the emergence of systematic structure. However, these properties arose from different mechanisms across species: children, unlike baboons, converged in behaviour over generations by copying specific patterns in a different location, thus introducing alternative copying mechanisms into the non-copying task. In children, prior biases towards specific shapes led to convergence in behaviour across chains, while baboon chains showed signs of lineage specificity. We conclude that CCE can result from mechanisms with varying degrees of fidelity in transmission and thus that high-fidelity copying is not necessarily the key to CCE.},

            Background
            The generation and systematic collection of genome-wide data is ever-increasing. This vast amount of data has enabled researchers to study relations between a variety of genomic and epigenomic features, including genetic variation, gene regulation, and phenotypic traits. Such relations are typically investigated by comparatively assessing genomic co-occurrence. Technically, this corresponds to assessing the similarity of pairs of genome-wide binary vectors. A variety of metrics have been proposed for this problem in other fields like ecology. However, while several of these metrics have been employed for assessing genomic co-occurrence, their appropriateness for the genomic setting has never been investigated.
          
          
            Results
            We show that the choice of metric may strongly influence results and propose two alternative modelling assumptions that can be used to guide this choice. On both simulated and real genomic data, the Jaccard index is strongly affected by dataset size and should be used with caution. The Forbes coefficient (fold change) and tetrachoric correlation are less affected by dataset size, but one should be aware of increased variance for small datasets.

It stretches from the large island of New Guinea in the northwest to the archipelago of Fiji in the east, at the border of western Polynesia. The islands forming the north of Melanesia were settled more than 30,000 years ago, well before the southern and eastern parts of Melanesia, the islands of which were discovered and settled by Lapita sailors only about 3,000 years ago (Kirch 2000). These seafaring groups, partly of Southeast Asian origins, introduced Austronesian traditions to the Pacific. Over the succeeding millennia, each founding settler society developed, transformed, and adapted to the later arrival of new groups, which allowed the evolution of unique traditions and languages. When this part of Oceania was first ``discovered'' by Europeans in the seventeenth/eighteenth centuries (Spriggs 1997), they were exposed to a unique and unparalleled cultural diversity in the archipelagos of Island Melanesia. Depending on the perspective considered, the arrival of Christian missionaries and western settlers in the numerous islands of the Pacific in the nineteenth century can be analyzed on a spectrum from an ``invasion'' of foreigners to merely the arrival of ``new canoes'' on the beaches of Oceania.},

The excavation of the ``\'Ecrins de Po\'e'' location (WBR047) was aimed to contribute to the study of a poorly known phase of the cultural chronology of this Island of Southern Melanesia, spanning the time-period between the end of the first millennium BC and the beginning of the first millennium AD. The opening of a series of trenches as well as some spatial excavations, have allowed to identify a number of major stratigraphic differences between the different areas. Most of the cultural layers in the back-part of the site (sector 2) had been removed before the excavations and only a few remains of early occupations were discovered. In the front part, facing the seashore (sector 1), excavations have identified a progressive extension of the beachfront starting about 2000 years ago, at the foot of a dune forming a beach-ridge. During nearly a millennium, the site was a regular settlement location, excavations unearthing remains of hearths, post-holes, stone ovens and rubbish pits. Excavations in the dune have shown clear succession of occupation layers, separated by abandonment phases. The progressive widening of the seashore plain led after the middle of the first millennium AD to a final abandonment of site WBR047 as a settlement, the dune being then mostly used as a burial location for over 500 years.},

  abstract = {The eponymous `Site 13' of Lapita on the west coast of New Caledonia's Grande Terre has a unique historical importance in the study of the Lapita Cultural Complex, being the first archaeological locality where dentate-stamped sherds were dated. It has also shown its richness, especially with the discovery of a series of complete pots, burial pits and preserved habitation features in the original sandy matrix. This chapter first summarises the different phases of archaeological study that have been undertaken at the site over the past century, highlighting the major damage that has occurred over the past decades. Second it presents a set of new archaeological data retrieved in early 2015, during the first phase of a cultural resource management project associated with road construction that risks leading to the destruction of a portion of the original Lapita occupation. A better understanding of the overall stratigraphic diversity of the site, as well as the presentation of a new set of radiocarbon dates and the main archaeological remains recovered, will highlight the spatial complexity of locality WKO013A and begin to provide a context for the large-scale excavations that may be conducted at the site in the near future.},

  abstract = {In the current state of knowledge, the European distribution of Acheulian industries that include handaxes and cleavers appears to be centered in southwestern Europe; their maximum northward expansion reaches England and Germany. North of latitude 52\textdegree{} and east of Germany and Italy, handaxe industries are conspicuously absent, occurring only sporadically in southeastern Europe. Handaxe industries are again well documented in western Asia, from Georgia to Israel and the Arabian Peninsula, clearly indicating an East African origin. The gap between eastern and western Eurasia and the high density of finds in the Iberian Peninsula suggests that the Acheulian in southwestern Europe may derive from the Maghreb, notwithstanding the lack of direct evidence for the crossing of the Straits of Gibraltar. In the Spanish Meseta the geological formations containing Acheulian industries are dated to the time range of OIS 11 to 6. The chronological gap between the earlier human occupation sites at Gran Dolina and in the Orce region and the Spanish Acheulian (an interval of about 300\textendash 400,000 years) would seem to reflect an earlier settlement in warm-temperate Europe that did not take a strong hold.},

We expand knowledge of the breadth and complexity of tool use in this species by providing the first descriptions of the form and function of two distinct tool sets used by chimpanzees in preying upon termites within the forests of the Goualougo Triangle, Republic of Congo. Further, we report the first application of remote video monitoring technology to record wild chimpanzee tool-using behavior. Based on tool assemblages recovered at termite nests, we hypothesized that chimpanzees were regularly visiting two forms of termite nests and using specific tools to extract termite prey depending on the structure of the nest. Six months of continuous remote video monitoring at six termite nests confirmed that chimpanzees use a tool set to puncture and fish at subterranean termite nests and another tool set to perforate and fish at epigeal (aboveground) nests. Our findings of strict adherence to tool forms at different nest types, tool material selectivity, repeated visits to nests with reusable wood tool assemblages, and differences in material culture between communities have broad implications for our understanding of the ecological and cultural factors that shape hominoid tool use.},

This chapter deals with the main steps of the FEM/DEM including contact detection, contact interaction, fracture and fragmentation algorithms, calculation of deformations and the time integration of the equation of motion. The FEM/DEM is advantageously used to simulate transition from continua to discontinua processes which may lead to the collapse of the structure.

  abstract = {The Poincar\'e plot is a geometrical technique used to visualise and quantify the correlation between two consecutive data points in a time-series. Since the dynamics of fluctuations in physiological rhythms exhibit long-term correlation and memory, this study aimed to extend the Poincar\'e plot by calculating the correlation between sequential data points in a time-series, rather than between two consecutive points. By incorporating this so-called lag, we hope to integrate a temporal aspect into quantifying the correlation, to depict whether a physiological system holds prolonged association between events separated by time. In doing so, it attempts to instantaneously characterise the intrinsic behaviour of a complex system. We tested this hypothesis on three different physiological time-series: heart rate variability in patients with liver cirrhosis, respiratory rhythm in asthma and body temperature fluctuation in patients with cirrhosis, to evaluate the potential application of the extended Poincar\'e method in clinical practice. When studying the cardiac inter-beat intervals, the extended Poincar\'e plot revealed a stronger autocorrelation for patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis compared to less severe cases using Pearson's correlation coefficient. In addition, long-term variability (known as SD2 in the extended Poincar\'e plot) appeared as an independent prognostic variable. This holds significance by acting as a non-invasive tool to evaluate patients with chronic liver disease and potentially facilitate transplant selection as an adjuvant to traditional criteria. For asthmatics, employing the extended Poincar\'e plot allowed for a non-invasive tool to differentially diagnose various classifications of respiratory disease. In the respiratory inter-breath interval analysis, the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) provided evidence that the extension of the Poincar\'e plot holds a greater advantage in the classification of asthmatic patients, over the traditional Poincar\'e plot. Lastly, the analysis of body temperature from patients using the extended Poincar\'e plot helped identify inpatients from outpatients with cirrhosis. Through these analyses, the extended Poincar\'e plot provided unique and additional information which could potentially make a difference in clinical practice. Conclusively, the potential use of our work lies in its possible application of predicting mortality for the organ allocation procedure in patients with cirrhosis and non-invasively distinguish between atopic and non-atopic asthma.},

To achieve this, a standardised taxonomic system, as well as consistent and valid criteria for the grouping of sites and assemblages, must be used. The Central European Late Palaeolithic (ca. 12,000\textendash 9700~cal BC) has a long research history and many regionally and temporally specific units\textemdash groups and cultures\textemdash are recognised. In this paper, we examine the complex taxonomic landscape of this period and critically analyse the use of typological, functional and economic criteria in the definition of selected groups. We subject three different archaeological taxonomic units, the Bromme culture from Denmark, the F\"urstein group from Switzerland and the Atzenhof group from Germany, to particularly detailed scrutiny and highlight that the classificatory criteria used in their definition are inconsistent across units and most likely unsuitable for circumscribing past sociocultural units. We suggest a comprehensive re-examination of the overarching taxonomic system for the Late Palaeolithic, as well as a re-evaluation of the methodologies used to delineate sociocultural units in the Palaeolithic.},

  abstract = {In the analysis of archaeological relationships and processes, a uniform classification of the dataset is a fundamental requirement. To achieve this, a standardised taxonomic system, as well as consistent and valid criteria for the grouping of sites and assemblages, must be used. The Central European Late Palaeolithic (ca. 12,000\textendash 9700~cal BC) has a long research history and many regionally and temporally specific units\textemdash groups and cultures\textemdash are recognised. In this paper, we examine the complex taxonomic landscape of this period and critically analyse the use of typological, functional and economic criteria in the definition of selected groups. We subject three different archaeological taxonomic units, the Bromme culture from Denmark, the F\"urstein group from Switzerland and the Atzenhof group from Germany, to particularly detailed scrutiny and highlight that the classificatory criteria used in their definition are inconsistent across units and most likely unsuitable for circumscribing past sociocultural units. We suggest a comprehensive re-examination of the overarching taxonomic system for the Late Palaeolithic, as well as a re-evaluation of the methodologies used to delineate sociocultural units in the Palaeolithic.},

The possibility of an Ater\'ian presence in the Arabian Peninsula is widely cited and is of particular interest, given the significant ongoing debate on the character of the dispersal(s) of Homo sapiens out of Africa. This paper presents a reanalysis of this data. Strong covariance was found between the tanged tools of the Bani Khatmah assemblage of south-western Saudi Arabia and the Ater\'ian of north-east Africa. Comparison with other technologically similar assemblages from the Saudi Arabian south-west, however, shows that this apparent similarity results from technological convergence rather than demographic connections with Ater\'ian populations. This convergence is likely to date to the Holocene.},

In West Africa, Terminal Pleistocene/Holocene aged human fossils, demonstrating the late continuity of archaic morphological features in the region have been linked to models of surprisingly recent admixture processes between late archaic hominins and H. sapiens. However, the limited chronological resolution of the archaeological record has prevented evaluation of how these biological records relate to patterns of behaviour. Here, we provide a preliminary report of the first excavated and dated Stone Age site in northern Senegal which features the youngest Middle Stone Age (MSA) technology yet documented in Africa. Ndiay\`ene Pendao features classic MSA core axes, basally thinned flakes, Levallois points and denticulates mostly made from chert. Similar technological features characterise several, larger surface sites in the vicinity. From this, it is postulated that populations using `anachronistic' technologies in the Lower Senegal Valley around the transition to the Holocene may have been widespread, in sharp contrast to other areas of Senegal and West Africa. The chronology and technology of Ndiay\`ene Pendao provides the first cultural evidence to support a complex evolutionary history in West Africa. This is consistent with a persistently high degree of Pleistocene population substructure in Africa and the spatially and temporally complex character of behavioural and biological evolution.},

The assemblage includes mainly waste products from bifacial tool manufacture and maintenance processes. The refitted sequences reflect initial reduction stages as well as advanced re-sharpening and recycling activities. The reconstructed reduction processes include decortication by removal of large flakes, and further shaping by removal of different types of thinning-flakes, probably using a hard hammer. Additional processes reflected by refitting, include post-polish re-sharpening, which in some cases was presumably performed using a soft hammer. Finally, evidence of recycling of bifacial tools into cores is also apparent. The presence of refitted waste, attesting to a range of different reduction stages, performed in the same unknown workshop, perhaps by the same knapper, sheds light on the extent of involvement that the knapper/s had in the life-histories of bifacial tools.},

Our results suggest that Proto-Iroquoian dates to around 2624 bc, and that the Finger Lakes region of west-central New York is the most likely homeland. The results also revealed a strong relationship between linguistic dissimilarity and geographic distance, likely reflecting the isolating effects of spatial separation on the magnitude of linguistic exchange. The timing of language divergences seems to coincide with important events observable in the archaeological record, including the first evidence for the use of corn in New York and Ontario. The development of important Iroquoian cultural attributes such as the longhouse, matrilocal residence, and the intensification of agriculture all coincide with a period which saw most of the internal language divergences.},

  abstract = {Ethnographic research highlights that there are constraints placed on the time available to produce cultural artefacts in differing circumstances. Given that copying error, or cultural `mutation', can have important implications for the evolutionary processes involved in material culture change, it is essential to explore empirically how such `time constraints' affect patterns of artefactual variation. Here, we report an experiment that systematically tests whether, and how, varying time constraints affect shape copying error rates. A total of 90 participants copied the shape of a 3D `target handaxe form' using a standardized foam block and a plastic knife. Three distinct `time conditions' were examined, whereupon participants had either 20, 15, or 10 minutes to complete the task. One aim of this study was to determine whether reducing production time produced a proportional increase in copy error rates across all conditions, or whether the concept of a task specific `threshold' might be a more appropriate manner to model the effect of time budgets on copy-error rates. We found that mean levels of shape copying error increased when production time was reduced. However, there were no statistically significant differences between the 20 minute and 15 minute conditions. Significant differences were only obtained between conditions when production time was reduced to 10 minutes. Hence, our results more strongly support the hypothesis that the effects of time constraints on copying error are best modelled according to a `threshold' effect, below which mutation rates increase more markedly. Our results also suggest that `time budgets' available in the past will have generated varying patterns of shape variation, potentially affecting spatial and temporal trends seen in the archaeological record. Hence, `time-budgeting' factors need to be given greater consideration in evolutionary models of material culture change.},

However, this relationship is surprisingly not well studied empirically from an explicitly ``microevolutionary'' perspective. Here, we experimentally simulated artifactual variation in two populations of ``artifact'' manufacturers, involving only a single behavioral difference in terms of their ``tradition'' of manufacturing tool. We then statistically analyzed shape variation in the resultant artifacts. In many respects, patterned differences might not have been expected to emerge given the simple nature of the task, the fact that only a single behavioral variable differed in our two populations, and all participants copied the same target artifact. However, multivariate analyses identified significant differences between the two ``assemblages.'' These results have several implications for our understanding and theoretical conceptualization of the relationship between behavior and artifactual variability, including the analytical potency of conceiving of artifacts as the product of behavioral ``recipes'' comprised of individual ``ingredient'' behavioral properties. Indeed, quite trivial behavioral differences, in generating microevolutionarily potent variability, can thus have long-term consequences for artifactual changes measured over time and space. Moreover, measurable ``cultural'' differences in artifacts can emerge not necessarily only because of a strict ``mental template'' but as the result of subtle differences in behavioral ingredients that are socially learned at the community level.},

  abstract = {Following the stratigraphic sequence described by D. Garrod in her pioneering excavations at Tabun Cave, the Levantine Mousterian is traditionally divided into three sub-stages (B, C, D) according to changes in modal forms of Levallois production. Despite the ubiquity of this terminology, none of these three stages from Tabun has been described in detail. Furthermore, our knowledge of variability in technology and chronology within the Levantine Middle Paleolithic has increased markedly in the last three decades. This variation is especially apparent in the Early Middle Paleolithic, when both Levallois and non-Levallois laminar methods appear in most sites but with different frequencies. In this paper we provide a reconstruction of the Levallois technology in the early Middle Paleolithic of Tabun Cave using assemblages from Jelinek's excavations in Unit IX (Garrod's layer D). In contrast to many other contemporary sites, where non-Levallois laminar production is strongly represented, the assemblage of Unit IX is dominated by a recurrent, unipolar Levallois technology. Understanding the specific character of the ``prototype'' of Tabun D is an important step towards assessing inter- and intra-assemblage variability within the Levantine Early Middle Paleolithic. Appreciating this variation is in turn essential for explaining the apparently sudden appearance of these early Mousterian assemblages between 200 and 250 kya. The method used at Tabun Unit IX is both flexible and efficient, yielding both large numbers of blanks and a range of products while reducing the waste of material involved in shaping and maintaining of the core. In these assemblages, blades, flakes and Levallois points, and a variety of other products, were produced through systematic exploitation of different parts of the core's surface. In this respect the technology of Tabun Unit IX differs from the `laminar method' known from other early Levantine assemblages in the organization of production and in its economic features and the range of products.},

Previously it was only possible to estimate phylogenetic trees with distance methods in R. phangorn, now offers the possibility of reconstructing phylogenies with distance based methods, maximum parsimony or maximum likelihood (ML) and performing Hadamard conjugation. Extending the general ML framework, this package provides the possibility of estimating mixture and partition models. Furthermore, phangorn offers several functions for comparing trees, phylogenetic models or splits, simulating character data and performing congruence analyses.},

  abstract = {Accurately dating when people first colonized new areas is vital for understanding the pace of past cultural and environmental changes, including questions of mobility, human impacts and human responses to climate change. Establishing effective chronologies of these events requires the synthesis on multiple 14C dates. Various `chronometric hygiene' protocols have been used to refine 14C dating of island colonization, but they discard up to 95\% of available 14C dates leaving very small datasets for further analysis. Despite their foundation in sound theory, without independent tests we cannot know if these protocols are apt, too strict or too lax. In Iceland, an ice-core dated tephrochronology of the archaeology of first settlement enables us to evaluate the accuracy of 14C chronologies. This test demonstrated that the inclusion of wider range of samples for 14C dates in Bayesian models improves the precision, but does not affect the model outcome. Therefore, based on our assessments, we advocate a new protocol that works with a much wider range of samples and where outlying 14C dates are systematically disqualified using Bayesian Outlier Models. We show that this approach can produce robust termini ante quos for colonization events and may be usefully applied elsewhere.},

We employed methods previously used in Africa but novel in Australia to infer long-term directional changes in the relative frequency of silcrete artefacts that were heat-treated. Our methods involved independent and crossverifying tests of the presence or absence of heat treatment, employing visual classifications and surface roughness measures. These methods revealed a coherent series of increases over time in the landscapes around Sydney, so that Late Holocene assemblages displayed higher rates of heat treatment than terminal Pleistocene or Early Holocene ones. We hypothesise that the directional trend towards greater frequencies of heat-treated artefacts on Australia's eastern seaboard is explicable in terms of the context of technological shifts towards microlith production superimposed onto an even longer term process of lithic resource depletion, perhaps compounded with the development of political barriers to the redistribution of knappable stone.},

  abstract = {Silcrete heat treatment, along with a suit of other innovations, have been used to argue for an early onset of modern or complex behaviours in Middle Stone Age hominins. This practice was confined to South Africa's southern and western Cape regions where it was continuously practised since the Still Bay industry. However, the exact moment that this technological advancement occurred still remains unclear. This is partly due to the scarcity of silcrete assemblages dating to the first half of the Middle Stone Age. To determine when silcrete heat treatment began to be well-established, we compare the silcrete assemblages from two archaeological sites situated along the south western coast of South Africa: Hoedjiespunt 1, one of the earliest Middle Stone Age silcrete assemblages dating to 119\textendash 130\,ka, and Duinefontein 2, one of the latest Early Stone Age assemblages dating to 200\textendash 400\,ka. Our results suggest that the invention of heat treatment occurred sometime between 130\,ka and 200\textendash 400\,ka, as it is still absent in the earlier assemblage but fully mastered and well-integrated in the recent one. This period corresponds to the time that Homo sapiens became the major hominin species in the southern African subcontinent and it is roughly the time that silcrete use became widespread in the second half of the Cape-coastal Middle Stone Age. This opens interesting new questions on the relation between silcrete use and heat treatment and on why early modern humans spontaneously invented heat treatment when they began using silcrete in the Cape region.},

Adopting this perspective encourages reconsideration of the ways in which such core concepts as structure, agency, and society can be redefined to cast new light on ancient power contests. In addition, we suggest that a network approach complements traditional emphases on processes of domination and resistance by drawing attention to the importance of alliances in shaping political formations. The potential utility of these precepts is illustrated in an example drawn from our research on Terminal Classic (800\textendash 1000 AD) political struggles in the Naco valley of northwestern Honduras. Special attention in this case centers on the manner in which craft products were manipulated by people of varying ranks to define and achieve goals as well as to control the actions of others.

Here, we first review the most commonly used procedure for documenting animal culture: the method of exclusion, which charts geographic behavioral variation between populations as evidence for culture. Using published data, we show that, whereas it is an adequate proof of principle, the method of exclusion has major deficiencies when capturing cultural diversity and complexity. Therefore, we propose a new method, namely the direct counting of socially learned skills, which we apply to previously collected data on wild orangutans. This method reveals a far greater cultural repertoire among orangutans, and a different distribution of cultural elements among behavioral domains than found by the method of exclusion, as well as clear ecological correlates for most cultural elements. The widespread occurrence of social learning ability throughout the animal kingdom suggests that these conclusions also apply to many other species. Culture is most likely more widespread and pervasive than commonly thought and an important avenue to local adaptation. The complex and normative dimensions of culture seem unique to our species, but were most likely built upon a very broad, pre-existing cultural capacity that we inherited from our ancestors.},

  abstract = {Animal species that live in complex foraging niches have, in general, improved access to energy-rich and seasonally stable food sources. Because human food procurement is uniquely complex, we ask here which conditions may have allowed species to evolve into such complex foraging niches, and also how niche complexity is related to relative brain size. To do so, we divided niche complexity into a knowledge-learning and a motor-learning dimension. Using a sample of 78 primate and 65 carnivoran species, we found that two life-history features are consistently correlated with complex niches: slow, conservative development or provisioning of offspring over extended periods of time. Both act to buffer low energy yields during periods of learning, and may thus act as limiting factors for the evolution of complex niches. Our results further showed that the knowledge and motor dimensions of niche complexity were correlated with pace of development in primates only, and with the length of provisioning in only carnivorans. Accordingly, in primates, but not carnivorans, living in a complex foraging niche requires enhanced cognitive abilities, i.e., a large brain. The patterns in these two groups of mammals show that selection favors evolution into complex niches (in either the knowledge or motor dimension) in species that either develop more slowly or provision their young for an extended period of time. These findings help to explain how humans constructed by far the most complex niche: our ancestors managed to combine slow development (as in other primates) with systematic provisioning of immatures and even adults (as in carnivorans). This study also provides strong support for the importance of ecological factors in brain size evolution.},

  abstract = {In this study, we present a detailed family-level phylogenetic hypothesis for the largest avian order (Aves: Passeriformes) and an unmatched multi-calibrated, relaxed clock inference for the diversification of crown passerines. Extended taxon sampling allowed the recovery of many challenging clades and elucidated their position in the tree. Acanthisittia appear to have diverged from all other passerines at the early Paleogene, which is considerably later than previously suggested. Thus, Passeriformes may be younger and represent an even more intense adaptive radiation compared to the remaining avian orders. Based on our divergence time estimates, a novel hypothesis for the diversification of modern Suboscines is proposed. According to this hypothesis, the first split between New and Old World lineages would be related to the severing of the Africa\textendash South America biotic connection during the mid\textendash late Eocene, implying an African origin for modern Eurylaimides. The monophyletic status of groups not recovered by any subsequent study since their circumscription, viz. Sylvioidea including Paridae, Remizidae, Hyliotidae, and Stenostiridae; and Muscicapoidea including the waxwing assemblage (Bombycilloidea) were notable topological findings. We also propose possible ecological interactions that may have shaped the distinct Oscine distribution patterns in the New World. The insectivorous endemic Oscines of the Americas, Vireonidae (Corvoidea), Mimidae, and Troglodytidae (Muscicapoidea), probably interfered with autochthonous Suboscines through direct competition. Thus, the Early Miocene arrival of these lineages before any other Oscines may have occupied the few available niches left by Tyrannides, constraining the diversification of insectivorous Oscines that arrived in the Americas later. The predominantly frugivorous\textendash nectarivorous members of Passeroidea, which account for most of the diversity of New World-endemic Oscines, may not have been subjected to competition with Tyrannides. In fact, the vast availability of frugivory niches combined with weak competition with the autochthonous passerine fauna may have been crucial for passeroids to thrive in the New World.},

They are formulated from simple models that account for the pile-up phenomenon, in which two or more photons are counted as one. These models are based on the Poisson process, but they have an extra parameter which includes all the detailed mechanisms of the pile-up process that must be fitted to the data statistics simultaneously with the rate parameter. The new probability distributions, one for number of counts per time bins (Poisson-like), and the other for waiting times (exponential-like) are tested fitting them to statistics of real data, and between them through numerical simulations, and their results are analyzed and compared. The probability distributions presented here can be used as background statistical models to derive likelihood functions for statistical methods in signal analysis.},

The Massim islands of eastern New Guinea significantly reduced in size throughout the Holocene ({$\leqslant$}11.7 kya), providing a unique opportunity to investigate the long-term adaptive capabilities of humans to changing island ecosystems. Here, we report a 2500-2300 year cultural sequence on Nimowa Island in the Louisiade Archipelago of the Massim region which began with the arrival of a late Lapita population during initial beachfront development. Sediment analyses indicate earlier settlement on the island would not have been possible as the coastline was unstable until near-modern sea levels were reached. The island was abandoned from 1290 to 530 cal. BP during a period of unusually dry conditions (`Medieval Climate Anomaly') and probable freshwater shortages. Re-settlement coincided with wetter climatic conditions (`Little Ice Age'), associated with the establishment of large villages, the earliest expression of local pottery traditions and the onset of large-scale regional exchange networks. Import of non-local obsidian reflects two pulses of interaction followed by periods of increased isolation. With the absence of high-quality lithic resources, shell, coral and bone were used as a locally available alternative for tool production. Increased cyclone frequency from \textasciitilde 500 cal. BP greatly increased beach volume in the island and coastal New Guinea, which facilitated the movement of populations onto smaller islands. A late prehistoric shift in settlement patterns had a profound impact on regional social dynamics.},

The Rossel tools are described and compared to other waisted assemblages from across Sahul, the Bismarck Archipelago and the Solomon Islands, with the morphological and technological attributes of the Rossel assemblage similar to some of the earliest comparative examples. Although undated, it is suggested that the waisted tools from Rossel Island belong to a previously undocumented Late Pleistocene stone tool tradition in the Massim, at a time when many of the islands were much larger or formed a continuation of the New Guinea mainland.

  abstract = {This paper proposes that complex projectile weaponry was a key strategic innovation driving Late Pleistocene human dispersal into western Eurasia after 50 Ka. It argues that complex projectile weapons of the kind used by ethnographic hunter-gatherers, such as the bow and arrow, and spearthrower and dart, enabled Homo sapiens to overcome obstacles that constrained previous human dispersal from Africa to temperate western Eurasia. In the East Mediterranean Levant, the only permanent land bridge between Africa and Eurasia, stone and bone projectile armatures like those used in the complex weapon systems of recent humans appear abruptly ca 45\textendash 35 Ka in early Upper Paleolithic contexts associated with Homo sapiens fossils. Such artifacts are absent from Middle Paleolithic contexts associated with Homo sapiens and Neandertals. Hypotheses concerning the indigenous vs. exogenous origins of complex projectile weaponry in the Levant are reviewed. Current evidence favors the hypothesis that complex projectile technology developed as an aid to ecological niche broadening strategies among African populations between 50\textendash 100 Ka. It most likely spread to western Eurasia along with dispersing Homo sapiens populations. Neandertals did not routinely deploy projectile weapons as subsistence aids. This puzzling gap in their otherwise impressive record for survival in some of the harshest environments ever occupied by primates may reflect energetic constraints and time-budgeting factors associated with complex technology.},

Both these hominids are associated with the Levantine Mousterian stone tool industry and similar sets of faunal remains.

Recent radiometric dates for Levantine Middle Paleolithic contexts challenge this hypothesis. Instead, they suggest the evolutionary relationships between these hominids were far more complicated. Proposed models for Neandertal and early modern human coevolutionary relationships are examined. Intense competition between Neandertals and early modern humans for a narrow human "niche" may be the context out of which the Upper Paleolithic behavioral "revolution" arose.},

The assemblages are dominated by relatively high-quality raw materials procured as pebbles from local gravels. The principal modes of core preparation are radial/centripetal Levallois and discoidal. Retouched tools are rare. Foliate bifaces are present, as are larger tools, such as handaxes, picks, and lanceolates, but these are more common among surface finds than among excavated assemblages.

  abstract = {Projectile weaponry is a human cultural universal, but its origins and antiquity remain poorly understood. Stone- and bone-tipped projectile weapons have long been treated as emergent features of the "Upper Paleolithic" behavioral revolution. Recently it has been proposed that projectile technology was in widespread use among Homo sapiens populations in Africa during Middle Stone Age (MSA) times. One obstacle to researching the origins of projectile point technology is that the criteria archaeologists employ for recognizing plausible and implausible stone projectile points are largely subjective (overall tool shape, microwear traces). Tip cross-sectional area (TCSA) is a ballistically significant dimension that works well at discriminating North American stone projectile points (spearthrower dart tips and arrowheads) from spear points. This paper compares the TCSA values of ethnographic North American stone projectile points to hypothetical Middle and Upper Paleolithic stone projectile points from Africa, the Levant, and Europe. The results of this comparison do not support the hypothesis of widespread use of stone-tipped projectiles in Africa, the Levant, or Europe prior to 40 Ka. In the New World and in Australia, where we have the richest ethnographic record of stone projectile point use, these implements are largely employed in big-game hunting and in warfare. One or both of these factors may have played a role in the widespread adoption of stone projectile point technology after 40 Ka.},

  abstract = {Following on the work of Dunnell, the evolutionary archaeology school has made a sharp distinction between functional and stylistic variation in archaeological artifacts. Variation is defined as functional if it is affected by selection processes and as stylistic if it is a result of processes of random drift. The argument has been further developed by Neiman (1995), who showed by simulation that processes of cultural mutation and drift could produce the kinds of "battleship curves" that generally characterize artifact-style frequency distributions through time, and also demonstrated that they could account for patterns of stylistic variation through time in Woodland-period ceramic assemblages from Illinois. In this paper we present a case study of change in the decoration of pottery from early Neolithic Central Europe. We show that the actual diachronic frequency distributions and those expected under the neutral model do not coincide and conclude that in this case the neutral model does not provide an adequate description of change in ceramic decoration. A model involving selection, in the form of a bias in favor of novelty in the later phases of the period studied, seems likely to be more appropriate, and we note the social interpretation of the original investigator of the data. In conclusion, it is suggested that neutral models provide an important heuristic tool but that there is not a radical break between functional and stylistic variation.
          , 
            R\'esum\'e
            Siguiendo a Dunnell, la escuela de `arqueolog\'ia evolucionista' ha profesado una clara distinci\'on entre la variati\'on funcional y la variaci\'on estil\'istica de los artefactos arqueol\'ogicos. Se puede definir variaci\'on como funcional si \'esta es afectada porprocesos de selecti\'on y como estil\'istica si es el resultado de procesos de deriva aleatoria. Este argumento ha sido desarrollado en mayor detalle por Neiman (1995), quien demostr\'o por medio de estudios de simulati\'on que los procesos de mutati\'on y deriva producen los tipos de curvas en forma de ``barcos de batalla '' que generalmente caracterizan la distributi\'on de estilos del artefacto y qui\'en adem\'as demostr\'o que estos procesos explican los patrones de variaci\'on estil\'istica de los conjuntos cer\'amicos del per\'iodo Woodland en Illinois. En este ensayo nosotros presentamos un ejemplo del cambio de la decorati\'on en la cer\'amica del Neolitico temprano de Europa Central.

Here we use archaeological data for this purpose, which brings in a temporal as well as spatial dimension. We analyse two distinct material cultures (pottery and personal ornaments) from Neolithic Europe, in order to: a) determine whether archaeologically defined ``cultures'' exhibit marked discontinuities in space and time, supporting the existence of a population structure, or merely isolation-by-distance; and b) investigate the extent to which cultures can be conceived as structuring ``cores'' or as multiple and historically independent ``packages''. Our results support the existence of a robust population structure comparable to previous studies on human culture, and show how the two material cultures exhibit profound differences in their spatial and temporal structuring, signalling different evolutionary trajectories.},

These profound changes are usually attributed to new major dispersals of Anatomically Modern Humans in Western Eurasia and the process of Neanderthals extinction and their replacement by Anatomically Modern humans. New lines of evidence and studies from pertinent geographical regions are essential to improve current explanatory models and hypotheses. The Zagros Mountain range in the west of Iran with its Intermountain eco-cultural niches is one of the areas that increasingly contribute to our knowledge of the transitional period from Middle to Upper Paleolithic in Southwestern Asia. This paper examines the lithic-based dominant hypothesis of continuity in Zagros through a more technology oriented view and put together all the evidence to build a broader overview of the Baradostian or the Early Upper Paleolithic of Zagros and its industrial evolution.},

  abstract = {Following the stratigraphic sequence described by D. Garrod in her pioneering excavations at Tabun Cave, the Levantine Mousterian is traditionally divided into three sub-stages (B, C, D) according to changes in modal forms of Levallois production. Despite the ubiquity of this terminology, none of these three stages from Tabun has been described in detail. Furthermore, our knowledge of variability in technology and chronology within the Levantine Middle Paleolithic has increased markedly in the last three decades. This variation is especially apparent in the Early Middle Paleolithic, when both Levallois and non-Levallois laminar methods appear in most sites but with different frequencies. In this paper we provide a reconstruction of the Levallois technology in the early Middle Paleolithic of Tabun Cave using assemblages from Jelinek's excavations in Unit IX (Garrod's layer D). In contrast to many other contemporary sites, where non-Levallois laminar production is strongly represented, the assemblage of Unit IX is dominated by a recurrent, unipolar Levallois technology. Understanding the specific character of the ``prototype'' of Tabun D is an important step towards assessing inter- and intra-assemblage variability within the Levantine Early Middle Paleolithic. Appreciating this variation is in turn essential for explaining the apparently sudden appearance of these early Mousterian assemblages between 200 and 250 kya. The method used at Tabun Unit IX is both flexible and efficient, yielding both large numbers of blanks and a range of products while reducing the waste of material involved in shaping and maintaining of the core. In these assemblages, blades, flakes and Levallois points, and a variety of other products, were produced through systematic exploitation of different parts of the core's surface. In this respect the technology of Tabun Unit IX differs from the `laminar method' known from other early Levantine assemblages in the organization of production and in its economic features and the range of products.},

  abstract = {The Acheulo-Yabrudian complex which constitutes the latest part of the Lower Paleolithic in the Levant provides a perspective over the nature of the transition between the Lower and Middle Paleolithic in the region. Considering the fundamental transformation in human behavior that occurred during the Acheulo-Yabrudian complex, which includes the use of habitual fire and the intensive use of predetermined blank technology among the emergence of other traits, it is of significance whether these transformations continued in the Levant from the Lower Paleolithic to the Middle Paleolithic or whether they were completely swept away by a new wave of humans bringing with them similar as well as different sets of behaviours. This question can be best elucidated through a search of continuity in technological choices which can reflect socially-learned traditions of stone knapping. Our study is carried out on the long 16 m deep archeological sequence of Tabun Cave, by combining results from Ronen's and Jelinek's excavations, which comprise ca. 100 superimposed layers, ranging from the Lower to the Middle Paleolithic. An overview of various reduction sequences, i.e., the Yabrudian scraper-blank production, the blade production of the Amudian, the exploitation of various types of cores on flakes, the variable exploitation of handaxes as cores and the Levallois technology at the site, indicates that although the Acheulo-Yabrudian and the Levantine Mousterian complexes exhibit marked differences in the macro level, there are also some significant features of similarity in the micro level, as reflected in particular technological choices within the reduction sequences that suggest some continuity in technological tradition. Exploring all ranges of reduction sequences can also provide new insights regarding the development of Levallois technology that burst at the Middle Paleolithic and demonstrate how particular technological choices that were already embedded in the knapping tradition of the Acheulo-Yabrudian are manifested in the particular method of Levallois that characterize the Mousterian of Tabun Cave.},

None of these mammoth megasites is dated prior to the appearance of modern humans in Eurasia. This unusual type of site begs for taphonomic explanation. The large number of individual mammoths and the scarcity of carnivore toothmarks and gnawing suggest a new ability to retain kill mammoths and control of carcasses. Age profiles of such mammoth-dominated sites with a large minimum number of individuals differ statistically at the p {$<$} 0.01 level from age profiles of Loxodonta africana populations that died of either attritional or catastrophic causes. However, age profiles from some mammoth sites exhibit a chain of linked resemblances with each other through time and space, suggesting the transmission of behavioral or technological innovation. I hypothesize that this innovation may have been facilitated by an early attempted domestication of dogs, as indicated by a group of genetically and morphologically distinct large canids which first appear in archaeological sites at about 32 ka B.P. (uncal). Testable predictions of this hypothesis are generated based on ethnographic data.},

  abstract = {The Wallacean archipelago between the Indian and Pacific Oceans is a critical biogeographic boundary for all kinds of animals, from butterflies to birds. Humans are no exception, and in this paper we offer a three stage model for how our genus overcame this boundary. We review how Lower Palaeolithic hominins were able to colonize the larger islands of western Wallacea through incidental seagoing, and subsistence on the megaherbivores that also made these crossings. However, Lower Palaeolithic hominins were not able to maintain geneflow between islands, nor cross into eastern Wallacea and beyond into Sahul. This biogeographic threshold persisted for hundreds of thousands of years until the arrival of our own species, whose cognitive capacities for planning and abstraction likely allowed for the construction of composite material rafts, interdependent paddles, and multiple-day seafaring. With the sea-level rise of the terminal Pleistocene and early Holocene a greater connectivity is seen in the form obsidian exchange networks, inter-island bead and fishhook traditions, and the colonization of very small islands entirely depauperate in terrestrial fauna. We suggest that the appearance of shell adzes at this time reflects the production of dugout canoes to facilitate regular inter-island voyaging. Wallacea presents a key case study both in the limits of Lower Palaeolithic hominin dispersal and the capacities that allowed Homo sapiens to go beyond these, as well as the intensification response of our species to rapid benign environmental change.},

  abstract = {In the 7 million years or so since humans shared a common ancestor with chimpanzees we have colonized more of the planet's terrestrial habitat than any other mammalian species and come to account for more biomass than all other terrestrial vertebrates combined. Chimpanzees, in contrast to and under pressure from ourselves, have veered toward extinction. There are multiple reasons for the stark evolutionary trajectories humans and chimpanzees have taken. Recent theoretical and empirical interest has focused on the emergence of cumulative culture whereby technological innovations are progressively incorporated into a population's stock of skills and knowledge, generating ever more sophisticated repertoires. Here we look at the role of high-fidelity imitation and intention-reading in the establishment of cumulative culture. By focusing on the lithic record, we aim to identify when in our evolutionary history these skills became part of our ancestors' behavioral repertoire. We argue that evidence of cooperative construction in stone tool manufacture, along with speculation regarding changes to the mirror neurone system, hint at the foundations of overimitation and shared intentionality around 2 million years ago. However, these are not the only ingredients of cumulative culture, which is why we do not see convincing evidence for it until slightly more than a million years later.},

Assemblages from eastern Asia and the Arabian peninsula are tested for their similarity to Acheulean assemblages in eastern Africa and the Indian sub-continent. Our expectation that the Arabian bifaces are part of the Acheulean tradition is confirmed. On the basis of metric ratios we conclude that the bifaces from Imjin and Hantan river basins in Korea and the Bose basin in China, are not part of the Acheulean tradition, suggesting independent development of bifacial forms. However the bifaces from the Luonan basin in China do resemble those of the Acheulean, indicating that there may have been intermittent dispersals of populations \-manufacturing Acheulean bifaces into eastern Asia.},

  abstract = {Stone adzes are found throughout the Pacific islands and documenting their diversity is critical to understanding relationships between past human populations. The adze typology devised by Roger Duff half a century ago is the standard across New Zealand and the rest of Polynesia. Here we describe the different types in the Duff system and analyse 148 adzes from the Wairau Bar site, which has a high diversity of complete adzes and is the assemblage that Duff used as the basis of his system. We use Principal Components Analysis of morphometric variables to test the empirical basis of the Duff system \textemdash{} an analytical exercise that should have applicability to typological systems elsewhere. Our results show different Duff types clustering separately to an extent, but there are issues of ambiguity in assigning types. Duff emphasized cross-section shape and the elaboration of the tang. We propose a new classification system that emphasizes technological and functional features of the adzes. There is considerable agreement between Duff's system and ours, as different manufacturing methods create different crosssection shapes, and functional modifications are often related to the adze tang. We describe four main manufacturing methods with functional elaborations, resulting in nine different adze types that are represented by at least 3 specimens each at Wairau Bar. Examples of each of these adze types are illustrated. We also note the presence of `stitched' edges on some adzes likely resulting from fine punch work. The Wairau Bar adzes are some of the finest examples of knapping skill known anywhere in the world and suggest a high level of craft specialization.},

Use life is to assemblage formation as lifespan is to demography, and demographers know that a population's mean lifespan is no more important than the distribution of values around that mean. When considered at all, use life typically is expressed as a mean value. But use-life's distribution\textemdash variation around the mean\textemdash affects assemblage composition independently of the mean. Distribution is neglected because its effects are not appreciated and seem difficult to measure. To improve understanding of assemblage formation, we study use-life distribution in New Guinea Wola ethnographic artifacts, using cumulative survivorship and the two-parameter Weibull model. Then we propose estimates of use-life distribution in Paleoindian stone tools. Knowing use-life distribution as well as mean, we know better how assemblages formed and improve our understanding of the archaeological record.

            Los conjuntos arqueol\'ogicos constan de proporciones de artefactos por categor\'ia. La vida \'util influye en la formaci\'on y, por lo tanto, el tama\~no y composici\'on de los conjuntos. La vida \'util se relaciona con la formaci\'on de conjuntos como la duraci\'on de vida se relaciona con la demograf\'ia, y los dem\'ografos saben que el tiempo promedio de vida no es m\'as importante que la distribuci\'on de valores respecto a la media. Cuando se consideran, t\'ipicamente la vida \'util se expresan como un valor promedio. Pero la distribuci\'on B variaci\'on de la vida util respecto a la media B afecta la composici\'on de los conjuntos en forma independiente de la media. Los arque\'ologos no prestan atenci\'on a la distribuci\'on, tal vez porque sus afectos no se aprecian y son dif\'iciles de medir. Para lograr un mejor entendimiento de la formaci\'on de conjuntos arqueol\'ogicos, en este art\'iculo se estudia la distribuci\'on de la vida \'util calculada para categor\'ias de artefactos o herramientas etnogr\'aficas Wola, de Nueva Guinea, con base en un modelo de supervivencia acumulativa y el modelo Weibull con dos par\'ametros. Adem\'as, se presentan c\'alculos de la distribuci\'on de la vida \'util de especimenes arqueol\'ogicos paleoindios. Al conocer la distribuci\'on de la vida \'util al igual que la media, se logra una mejor idea de c\'omo seforman los conjuntos y mejoramos nuestro entendimiento del registro arqueol\'ogico.},

  abstract = {The Altai is located in southern Siberia, Russia. Virtually all Altai Middle Paleolithic industries represent a single cultural tradition, within which two principal technological variants have been established \textendash{} Denisova and KaraBom. Among the key features of the Denisova variant (Denisova and Okladnikov cave sites and the open-air Tiumechin-1 site) are the predominance of parallel and radial flaking, a large share of tools on medium-sized and short flakes, various racloirs, including diagonal and canted scrapers, and distinctly Levallois tools. The techno-typological characteristics of the Kara-Bom variant (the sites of Kara-Bom, Ust-Karakol-1, Anui-3, UstKan Cave) are somewhat different. Here, primary reduction was based on the Levallois technique, mostly resulting in blades. The predominant tools are Levallois points and elongated Levallois flakes along with various notched-denticulate forms and Upper Paleolithic types. The likely technological precursors of the Altai Middle Paleolithic were Lower Paleolithic industries of the adjacent regions, characterized by advanced techniques of parallel and Levallois knapping and the manufacturing of standardized tools on a large scale. A wide distribution of Levallois-like Lower Paleolithic industries in territories bordering the Altai stimulated the autochthonous evolution of the Altai Middle Paleolithic as one of the Central Asian Paleolithic traditions.},

A new phase in the study of the site is associated with the works undertaken in the East Chamber during 2004\textendash 2016. A long stratigraphic sequence exposed in this part of the cave, like the strata of Pleistocene deposits in the Main Chamber, has become a reference section for the study of prehistory in the region. A large collection of archeological finds that quantitatively exceeds those recovered in previous years, new biostratigraphic and geochronological data obtained from Pleistocene deposits of the cave, make it possible to reconstruct the dynamics in the development of the Middle and Upper Paleolithic stone tool industries of the Altai on a qualitatively new level. The article presents the major techno-typological characteristics of the stone tool industries from the East Chamber, their stratigraphic, paleoecological and geochronological context. We show a correlation between the Paleolithic stone tool industries from the East Chamber and contemporary assemblages from the Main Chamber, as well as the cave entrance, and identify their place among other Paleolithic cave and open-air sites of the Altai. The continuity of a techno-typological sequence in the development of the stone tool industries from Denisova Cave and other stratified sites in the Altai and the emergence of the Upper Paleolithic from a local Middle Paleolithic tradition suggest that the stone tools and articles of personal adornment appear to have been produced by Denisovans. This conclusion is consistent with a complete lack of any fossil remains from anatomically modern humans in the Altai Paleolithic.},

These geological and archaeological sites provided the raw materials for tools such as toki (adzes and picks), which facilitated the manufacture of Easter Island's iconic stonework. Other basaltic tools such as hoe (knives), ohio (axes) and mangai ma\textasciimacron `ea (stone fishhooks) served for subsistence practices. However, little is known about the sources of these artefacts, the sequence of their manufacture and their geochemical compositions. In this paper, we provide archaeological site descriptions and geochemistry of source material from the Rua Tokitoki quarry and a fine-grain basalt locality on Poike to contribute towards an understanding of prehistoric mining, social interaction and elite oversight on this isolated East Polynesian outpost.},

Modalities of circulation are exposed. The analyses of these products demonstrate an important anticipation concerning the mobile raw materials' management. These data demonstrate that this Mousterian site is a point in a complex and ramified settlement of the landscape.

I present the process of manufacture then measure the variation in production characteristics at the site in terms of our current knowledge of Clovis biface technology. I conclude that Topper flintknappers used reduction strategies typical of Clovis-period tool production but created a biface assemblage with greater flexibility in design than documented at most other Clovis sites. This variation in biface production suggests greater variability in Clovis behavior across AmericadClovis groups adapted to local resource conditions and adjusted the organization of their technology accordingly.},

  abstract = {Human populations have extraordinary capabilities for generating behavioural diversity without corresponding genetic diversity or change. These capabilities and their consequences can be grouped into three categories: strategic (or cognitive), ecological and cultural-evolutionary. Strategic aspects include: (i) a propensity to employ complex conditional strategies, some certainly genetically evolved but others owing to directed invention or to cultural evolution; (ii) situations in which fitness payoffs (or utilities) are frequency-dependent, so that there is no one best strategy; and (iii) the prevalence of multiple equilibria, with history or minor variations in starting conditions (path dependence) playing a crucial role. Ecological aspects refer to the fact that social behaviour and cultural institutions evolve in diverse niches, producing various adaptive radiations and local adaptations. Although environmental change can drive behavioural change, in humans, it is common for behavioural change (especially technological innovation) to drive environmental change (i.e. niche construction). Evolutionary aspects refer to the fact that human capacities for innovation and cultural transmission lead to diversification and cumulative cultural evolution; critical here is institutional design, in which relatively small shifts in incentive structure can produce very different aggregate outcomes. In effect, institutional design can reshape strategic games, bringing us full circle.},

While reciprocity explains many instances of non-kin cooperation, much remains to be understood. A recent suite of models based upon `cooperative assortativity' suggest that non-kin cooperation can evolve if individuals preferentially assort with certain cooperative phenotypes, such as helping those who help others. Here, we test these assortative hypotheses among the Agta, a population of Filipino hunter-gatherers, using an experimental resource allocation game in which individuals divide resources between themselves and camp-mates. Individuals preferentially shared with less cooperative individuals, arguing against cooperative assortativity as a mechanism sustaining resource transfers in this population. Rather, sharing was often based on the recipient's level of need, in addition to kin-based transfers and reciprocal sharing. Contrary to several recent theoretical accounts, in this real-world setting we find no evidence for cooperative assortativity influencing patterns of cooperation. These results may reflect the demands of living in a foraging ecology characterized by high resource stochasticity, necessitating need-based sharing as a system of long-term reciprocity to mitigate repeated subsistence shortfalls.},

Results link morphologies and technologies of Clovis, certain western Canadian, and northern fluted points, suggesting that fluting technology arrived in the Arctic from a proximate source in the interior Ice-Free Corridor and ultimately from the earliest populations in temperate North America, complementing new genomic models explaining the peopling of the Americas.},

  abstract = {The African Middle Pleistocene (781e126 ka) is a key period for human evolution, witnessing both the origin of the modern human lineage and the lithic turnover from Earlier Stone Age (ESA) Acheulean bifacial tools to Middle Stone Age (MSA) prepared core and point technologies. This ESA/MSA transition is interpreted as representing changing landscape use with greater foraging distances and more active hunting strategies. So far, these behavioral inferences are mainly based on the extensive stone tool record, with only a minor role for site-based and regional faunal studies. To provide additional insights into these behavioral changes, this paper details a pan-African metastudy of 63 Middle Pleistocene faunal assemblages from 40 sites. A hierarchical classification system identified 26 well-contextualized assemblages with quantitative paleontological and/or zooarcheological data available for detailed comparative analyses and generalized linear mixed modeling. Modeling of ungulate body size classes structured around three dimensions (context, antiquity and technology) illustrates no one-to-one correlation between changes in lithic technology (Acheulean vs. MSA) and changes in prey representation. All assessed faunal assemblages are dominated by medium-sized bovids, and variations between smaller and larger body size classes are linked to site context (cave vs. open-air), with an increase in cave sites during the Middle Pleistocene. Current data do not signal a broadening of the hominin dietary niche during the Middle Pleistocene; no meaningful variation was visible in the exploitation of smaller-sized bovids or dangerous game, with coastal resources exploited when available. Proportions of anthropogenic bone surface modifications, and hence carcass processing intensity, do increase over time although more zooarcheological data is crucial before making behavioral inferences. Overall, this paper illustrates the potential of broad scale comparative faunal analyses to provide additional insights into processes of human behavioral evolution and the mechanisms underlying patterns of technological, chronological and contextual change.},

The Neanderthals inhabited cooler and more seasonal periods than the modern human, evincing childhood developmental stress during wintertime. In one instance, this stress may have included skeletal mobilization of elemental stores and weight loss; this individual was born in the spring and appears to have weaned 2.5 years later. Both Neanderthals were exposed to lead at least twice during the deep winter and/or early spring.

An analysis of 369 complete African L3 sequences places this maximum at {$\sim$}70 ka, virtually ruling out a successful exit before 74 ka, the date of the Toba volcanic supereruption in Sumatra. The similarity of the age of L3 to its two non-African daughter haplogroups, M and N, suggests that the same process was likely responsible for both the L3 expansion in Eastern Africa and the dispersal of a small group of modern humans out of Africa to settle the rest of the world. The timing of the expansion of L3 suggests a link to improved climatic conditions after {$\sim$}70 ka in Eastern and Central Africa rather than to symbolically mediated behavior, which evidently arose considerably earlier. The L3 mtDNA pool within Africa suggests a migration from Eastern Africa to Central Africa {$\sim$}60 to 35 ka and major migrations in the immediate postglacial again linked to climate. The largest population size increase seen in the L3 data is 3-4 ka in Central Africa, corresponding to Bantu expansions, leading diverse L3 lineages to spread into Eastern and Southern Africa in the last 3-2 ka.},

The Russian Plain occupies the southern half of the European USSR. It is bordered on the west by the Carpathian Mountains and on the east by the Urals. The area was densely occupied during the Upper Paleolithic and over 1000 sites and localities from this period are known in the archeological record. The chapter discusses the 29 major Upper Paleolithic sites found on the Central Russian Plain. This area of some 180,000 km2 has produced spectacular sites with elaborate mammoth-bone dwellings, numerous storage pits, as well as examples of portable art, engravings, and a number of exotic materials including fossil marine shells originating at least 600 km south of the sites. Geographically, these sites have a number of common features. They are all found in loess or colluviums, primarily on the second terraces of their respective rivers or along the edges of plateaus next to the rivers. Two broad categories of sites have been found in the area .},

The book presents details of the archaeological inventories and assemblages found at the 29 sites, together with the geography and geology of the study area. It then uses environmental data to model environmental conditions and resource distribution during the various periods of human occupation, as well as to predict optimal strategies for exploiting available resources. Subsequent chapters present the relative and chronometric dating schemes. The book also elucidates the man-land relationships, ensuing subsistence strategies, settlement types present in the archaeological record, settlement systems, and sociopolitical behavior.

As a parallel experiment of innovation involving economic, historical and social components, artifacts define a universe of evolving properties that displays episodes of diversification and extinction. Here we critically review previous work comparing the two types of evolution. Like biological evolution, technological evolution is driven by descent with variation and selection, and includes tinkering, convergence and contingency. At the same time there are essential di{$\carriagereturn$}erences that make the two types of evolution quite distinct. Major distinctions are illustrated by current specific examples, including the evolution of cornets and the historical dynamics of information technologies. Due to their fast and rich development, the later provide a unique opportunity to study technological evolution at all scales with unprecedented resolution. Despite the presence of patterns suggesting convergent trends between man-made systems end biological ones, they provide examples of planned design that have no equivalent with natural evolution.},

One such beverage is tejate, from the Central Valleys of Oaxaca, Mexico. Tejate is a culturally and socially significant beverage, and because it is made with maize and frequently consumed in some rural households, its nutritional contribution may be meaningful. However, tejate preparation is labor intensive and this, combined with changes in the Central Valleys, is leading to changes in the persistence and geographic distribution of this important form of cacao consumption.},

Although the ``easygoing'' nature of the relationship between children and adults has been argued, previous hunter-gatherer research has given little attention to the children's participation in hunting and gathering activities and the details of oblique knowledge transmission during these activities. I collected data by video recording naturally occurring interactions between adults (or adolescents) and children during the children's participation in collective hunting, gathering, and other cultural activities such as butchering animals. The ages of the focal children ranged from 5 to 9 years old.The findings show that the adults' and adolescents' actions contributed to the children's building of situation-embedded knowledge. The focal children were able to adopt a social and cooperative stance toward the activities being performed, and the activities gave them access to various learning resources (other participants, phrases spoken during an activity, objects, tools, the immediate environment in which the children participate, etc.). From these findings, it becomes clear that the knowledge built in every social situation was not a one-sided endeavor, but rather a collaboration between experts and learners. The cognitive state and the body positioning of the children were taken into account by adults (or adolescents) in these learning contexts in order to facilitate the (re)production of knowledge by the children. This fact leads us to the conclusion that experts' sensitivity to learners and the learning contexts where they are situated are distinctive key characteristics of social learning in humans.},

  abstract = {The FEA Lapita pottery site on Boduna Island, West New Britain, is one of the most important Lapita sites of the Talasea region. Archaeological investigations in 1980 and 1985 concluded that the site has been disturbed and its stratigraphic integrity is insecure. Fieldwork in 1989 targeted this issue, and further work in 2001 examined the island's geological history. This paper describes the 1989 study, and concludes from the pottery from the various excavations and surface collections that there is residual evidence for stylistic change through time. Use of the island began c. 3340\textendash 3000 cal. bp, but no firm date can be suggested for the end of pottery use on the island. The island seems too small to have supported permanent occupation without importation of food or use of land elsewhere for gardening, and might have been used only intermittently by local residents or visiting groups, perhaps for special social or ritual activities similar to the use suggested by Kirch for zone C at ECA/B in the Mussau group.},

The nature and quality of the exposures would often have placed severe constraints on the production of flaked tools. The chert sources are compared with those of obsidian on the north side of New Britain, highlighting the potential advantages and problems of each. A small group of finely made stemmed chert tools is identified as potentially valuables similar to stemmed obsidian tools of the Willaumez Peninsula obsidian source region. While the chert examples differ in aspects of technology and form, they share with the obsidian forms the concept of bifacially-worked stems and were made during the same period. This is seen as indicating social relationships between the two areas during the middle Holocene comparable to that recently proposed between Manus and New Britain.},

Here we explore differences between two Lapita sites on Apugi Island near Kandrian and two in the Arawe Islands on the south side of New Britain, Papua New Guinea. In the Arawes, the Apalo and Makekur sites have rich assemblages with shell fishhooks, and coral and shell discs similar to those found in Lapita and later contexts across Oceania. In contrast, the less rich assemblages of the Rapie/Iangpun and Auraruo sites on Apugi Island lack similar fishhooks or discs. Three possible explanations for these differences are discussed: sample bias, environmental constraints, and cultural factors. While each may have contributed to some degree, we propose two scenarios involving cultural choices for further consideration: the selective uptake and transfer of new ideas between communities, and contrasting site functions between central places for ritual or trading activities (Arawes) versus unspecialised residential locales (Kandrian).},

During geoarchaeological surveys of the Jebel Gharbi carried out by the Italian\textendash Libyan Archaeological Mission, 25 Aterian sites were found. The technology of the Aterian lithic industries from the Jebel Gharbi shows affinities both with the Aterian industries from Morocco and coeval industries from Egypt such as Taramsa. The affinities between contemporary Libyan Aterian industries, Egyptian industries, and some series from the Levant open new perspectives on the possible models of contact and displacement of human groups in a key period for the history of humankind.},

These results are the background for the first region-wide research project focussing on obsidian characterisation and its role in prehistoric inter-island exchange. It is commonly held that distribution of obsidian in ISEA was only localised and inter-island transportation limited. The review, however, suggests that this hypothesis derives from an incomplete knowledge of obsidian distribution in the region rather than typifying prehistoric social patterns. Obsidian sourcing has been carried out only intermittently in ISEA since the 1970s and has generally been focussed only at the single site level, thus explaining this very partial understanding.},

  abstract = {Speculation on the relationships among pottery styles in the western Pacific started in the 1930s. Jim Specht's 1969 Ph.D. thesis brought this early period of speculation to an end by presenting a well-developed pottery sequence for Buka in the Northern Solomon Islands and relating it to emerging dated sequences from other parts of the Pacific. Following on from this research, and that of Kennedy and others, Spriggs in 1984 argued for cultural continuity between Lapita and post-Lapita pottery styles in Island Melanesia, and that post-Lapita stylistic changes continued in parallel over a large area until at least 1,500 B.P. Direct evidence of prehistoric contact between the various areas concerned seemed to support this idea. Wahome's 1998 thesis provided some statistical back-up to these ideas and presented a detailed pottery sequence for Manus which was then compared to other regional pottery sequences. The redating of the Mangaasi type-site in central Vanuatu by Spriggs and Bedford brought this important site into line with the dates for what was seen to be similar Incised \& Applied relief pottery elsewhere. However, recent theses by Clark and Bedford on Fijian and Vanuatu pottery, respectively, have questioned the reality of the claimed stylistic similarities in post-Lapita pottery across the region. Thus, a debate has been opened up on the levels of similarity between pottery styles and the meaning of any similarity found between them. Basic culture-historical questions remain unanswered by the data so far presented and there is a need for further sequence construction and regional comparison.},

  abstract = {Archaeological excavations at EF-HR and HWK EE allow reassessment of Bed II stratigraphy within the Junction Area and eastern Olduvai Gorge. Application of Sequence Stratigraphic methods provides a time-stratigraphic framework enabling correlation of sedimentary units across facies boundaries, applicable even in those areas where conventional timelines, such as tephrostratigraphic markers, are absent, eroded, or reworked. Sequence Stratigraphically, Bed II subdivides into five major Sequences 1 to 5, all floored by major disconformities that incise deeply into the underlying succession, proving that simple "layer cake" stratigraphy is inappropriate. Previous establishment of the Lemuta Member has invalidated the use of Tuff IIA as the boundary between Lower and Middle Bed II, now redefined at the disconformity between Sequences 2 and 3, a lithostratigraphic contact underlying the succession containing the Lower, Middle, and Upper Augitic Sandstones. HWK EE site records Oldowan technology in the Lower Augitic Sandstone at the base of Sequence 3, within Middle Bed II. We suggest placement of recently reported Acheulean levels at FLK W within the Middle Augitic Sandstone, thus emphasizing that handaxes are yet to be found in earlier stratigraphic units of the Olduvai sequence. This would place a boundary between the Oldowan and Acheulean technologies at Olduvai in the Tuff IIB zone or earliest Middle Augitic Sandstone. A major disconformity between Sequences 3 and 4 at and near EF-HR cuts through the level of Tuff IIC, placing the main Acheulean EF-HR assemblage at the base of Sequence 4, within Upper rather than Middle Bed II. Sequence stratigraphic methods also yield a more highly resolved Bed II stratigraphic framework. Backwall and sidewall surveying of archaeological trenches at EF-HR and HWK EE permits definition of ``Lake-parasequences'' nested within the major Sequences that record downcutting of disconformities associated with lake regression, then sedimentation associated with lake transgression, capped finally by another erosional disconformity or hiatal paraconformity caused by the next lake withdrawal. On a relative time-scale rather than a vertical metre scale, the resulting Wheeler diagram framework provides a basis for recognizing time-equivalent depositional episodes and the position of time gaps at various scales. Relative timing of archaeological assemblage levels can then be differentiated at a millennial scale within this framework.},

  abstract = {Reconstructing paleoenvironments and landscapes within lake-centered, hominin-yielding basinal sequences requires a resolution of time-rock units finer than but complementary to that provided by the present tephrostratigraphy. Although indispensable in providing an absolute time frame at Olduvai, the average 15,000e20,000 year intervals between successive tuff units lack the time resolution to construct a sufficiently contemporary paleolandscape within sedimentary intervals away from the interleaved tuffs. Such control is essential to construct valid paleogeographies in which to contextualize contemporaneous paleoanthropological sites and the traces of hominin land use they contain. Within Beds I and II of the Olduvai Basin a Sequence Stratigraphic analysis has achieved a relative time framework in which time-rock units, ``lake-parasequences,'' each generated by a major advance and withdrawal of the lake system, are recognizable for average periods of about 4000 years duration. Within each of these time slices at least two paleogeographic landscapes are identifiable, reducing the time constraints of an individual landscape reconstruction to a few thousand years. Within the sedimentary succession both highly incised and less incised unconformities are identifiable to provide sequence boundaries. Within each sequence the higher frequency lake-parasequences can be identified by (1) a disconformable base, (2) accretion of sediment during lake transgression and at maximum, (3) a disconformable top caused by lake withdrawal, and (4) a soil profile generated beneath that disconformable land surface. Individual lake-parasequences can be recognized in lake marginal and fan settings, and their imprint can also be seen in the lake setting where, for example, maximum flooding might be marked by a layer of dolomite. Lower Bed II parasequences represent time intervals of {$<$}5000 years, while parasequential periods between Tuffs IB and IC in Bed I are {$<$}4300 years. Analogous Holocene lake-level changes of the same order in East Africa have a period close to 4200 years. The estimated period is close to that defined by Stadial/Interstadial Dansgaard-Oeschger Events recorded in the Greenland Ice record, which force cycles of period similar to lake-parasequences, both in the Arabian Sea and Lake Malawi. Lake-parasequences not only aid construction of landscapes, they also allow contextualization of individual paleoanthropological occurrences. For instance, a parasequence lies between Leakey's Level 1 and her butchered Deinotherium occurrence at FLK N. However, elephantid and giraffid skeletons associated with stone artifacts at VEK, uncovered by OLAPP excavations, are situated on the same land surface as a possibly butchered rhinocerid at KK. To complement the existing absolute radiometric time framework, relative Sequence Stratigraphic techniques might be applied to any lake-centered, hominin-yielding basinal sequence, not only those found within East Africa. Because they are climatically controlled, and might plausibly be related to globally driven Dansgaard-Oeschger Events, lake-parasequences and their associated sequences might be correlatable between various East African basins in the Plio-Pleistocene in the same way as they presently are for the Holocene.},

However, most of the assemblages included in the discussion are from southern Africa, and we have limited knowledge about human paleoecology from other parts of the continent. This chapter aims to review the zooarchaeological record for Late Pleistocene human subsistence in northwestern Africa. This region provides some of the earliest and most complete fossil evidence for anatomically modern humans, and it provides a unique aspect of human technological development in the Aterian stone tool industry. Understanding the subsistence of these early people is important for understanding human behavioral evolution. Until recently, most faunal analyses from the region have been focused on paleontology, biostratigraphy, and environmental reconstructions. Zooarchaeological studies have been limited by sample size, excavation methods, and the lack of good comparative data. What is known of the Northwest African record is placed in the context of our knowledge of Middle Stone Age subsistence from the rest of Africa, and future research directions are offered. The current projects in Morocco, as discussed in this volume, will provide valuable insights into North African subsistence during the Late Pleistocene.},

The richness and good preservation of various evidence of human activity and remains of material culture allow exploration of many important aspects of the period often referred as ``the time of the last Neanderthals''. One important aspect of Zaskalnaya VI is the bone remains of Neanderthals, especially numerous in layers IIIa and III. One of two main focuses of this report is the presentation of anthropological data, with particular emphasis on the detailed odontological characterization of mandibles Zsk VI-72 and Zsk VI-78. The examined odontological complex is characterized by a set of morphological features and variations which are common for the line of Transition Neanderthals. Another focus of the paper is aimed at a wider presentation of data provided by layers IIIa and III, including the history of study, general stratigraphy and some peculiar stratigraphic and spatial features of layers IIIa and III, data on numerical chronology, technical and typological features of stone and bone industry, use-wear analysis data, paleontological and archaeozoological characteristics and other related evidence.},

  abstract = {There is a famous puzzle about the first 3 million years of archaeologically visible human technological history. The pace of change, of innovation and its uptake, is extraordinarily slow. In particular, the famous handaxes of the Acheulian technological tradition first appeared about 1.7 Ma, and persisted with little change until about 800 ka, perhaps even longer. In this paper, I will offer an explanation of that stasis based in the life history and network characteristics that we infer (on phylogenetic grounds) to have characterized earlier human species. The core ideas are that (i) especially in earlier periods of hominin evolution, we are likely to find archaeological traces only of widespread and persisting technologies and practices; (ii) the record is not a record of the rate of innovation, but the rate of innovations establishing in a landscape; (iii) innovations are extremely vulnerable to stochastic loss while confined to the communities in which they are made and established; (iv) the export of innovation from the local group is sharply constrained if there is a general pattern of hostility and suspicion between groups, or even if there is just little contact between adults of adjoining groups. That pattern is typical of great apes and likely, therefore, to have characterized at least early hominin social lives. Innovations are unlikely to spread by adult-to-adult interactions across community boundaries. (v) Chimpanzees and bonobos are characterized by male philopatry and subadult female dispersal; that is, therefore, the most likely early hominin pattern. If so, the only innovations at all likely to expand beyond the point of origin are those acquired by subadult females, and ones that can be expressed by those females, at high enough frequency and salience for them to spread, in the bands that the females join. These are very serious filters on the spread of innovation.This article is part of the theme issue `Life history and learning: how childhood, caregiving and old age shape cognition and culture in humans and other animals'.},

It is well established that the energetic cost of human walking is lower than that of representative mammals, particularly for individuals with long lower limbs. The current study reevaluates the daily energy expenditures of a variety of hominin species using more appropriate approaches to estimating locomotor costs. To estimate DEE for primates, I relied on published data on body mass, day range, and the percentage of time spent in various activities. Based on those data, I calculated a value for nonlocomotor DEE. I then used a variant of a method that I have suggested elsewhere to calculate the daily cost due to locomotion (DEEL) and summed the two to calculate total DEE. The more up-to-date methods for calculating the cost of travel result in lower estimates of this aspect of the energy budget than seen in previous studies. Values obtained here for DEE in various representatives of Australopithecus are lower than reported previously by around 200 kcal/day. Taking into account the greater economy of human walking, particularly the effect of the longer lower limbs found in many later Homo species, also results in lowered estimates of DEE. Elongation of the lower limbs in H. erectus reduced relative travel costs nearly 50\% in comparison to A.L. 288-1 (A. afarensis). The present method for calculating DEE indicates that female H. erectus DEE was 84\% greater than that of female Australopithecus; this disparity is even larger than that suggested by previous workers.},

We recorded the prevalence of deformed but healed branches and remnants of dead branches found around fresh nests at the savanna site of Issa in Ugalla, Tanzania. These old nest scars were found in 79\% of 112 beds. We also randomly selected potential nesting locations for a subset of 32 beds within the same trees, and found nest scars in only 19\% of these ``control'' locations. We then monitored 275 nests for up to 19 months for decay, regeneration of new branches, and re-use. Of these 275 nest locations, 24\% were re-used within the first nine months of monitoring, and most re-use occurred when the nest had already decayed and was not easily visible from the ground. After 18 months, the proportion of specific nest positions re-used increased to 48\%. This fidelity is likely a result of the creation of ideally-shaped support structures and supple new growth for mattress material with successive use of nest locations. We propose that specific nest site re-use may not be a direct product of environmental determination, but a result of ``niche construction'' through formation of good building sites within trees. Environmental modification through construction behaviour may have influenced both chimpanzee and early hominin ranging, and thus leaves behind recognisable patterns of artefact deposition across the landscape.},

Recent excavations yielded human and faunal remains, as well as exceptional archaeological objects (Middle, Upper Palaeolithic and Neolithic industries; ceramics; ornaments in Nassarius sp. shells; bone tools; pigments) associated with anthropic structures. The continuous sedimentary sequence of these sites covers the last climatic cycle (from the Eemian interglacial to the present one), and is studied in a renewed context from several points of view: geology, stratigraphy, chronology, cultures, anthropology, palaeontology, taphonomy, and zooarchaeology. Today, there is no equivalent of such regional data for the whole Late Pleistocene in North Africa. The study of small and large faunal remains, associated with chronological data, allowed us to obtain significant data on palaeoenvironments and human/carnivore occupations of the T\'emara caves. These data are included in a broader view of human occupations and their environmental context throughout North Africa during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene.},

These headlines all come from respected outlets with a connection to the academic community (Smithsonian, Science, and Nature, respectively). However, news media outlets with a more popular audience have also become interested in the stories and histories being revealed about our ancestors through modern and ancient DNA, and new toolkits include a heavy bioinformatics component. As expected, these headlines are a bit more sensational: ``Are you tall? Then thank your ancient cousins: Neanderthal DNA still helps dictate your HEIGHT and whether you suffer from lupus and schizophrenia'' reads a Daily Mail headline about Neanderthal admixture. Another reads: ``The `founding father' of Europe: DNA reveals all Europeans are related to a group that lived around 35,000 years ago.'' Yet another, seemingly contradictory, headline reads: ``Europeans drawn from three ancient `tribes.''' Communications technology has evolved in lockstep with advances in DNA recovery and analysis over the last two decades, perhaps giving the impression that studies of past population movements are a recent development. However, interest in ``ancient migrations'' has a deep history in western science, beginning with analyses of the skull using what are now referred to as biological distance methods.},

  abstract = {Stone tools provide some of the most abundant, continuous, and high resolution evidence of behavioral change over human evolution, but their implications for cognitive evolution have remained unclear. We investigated the neurophysiological demands of stone toolmaking by training modern subjects in known Paleolithic methods (``Oldowan'', ``Acheulean'') and collecting structural and functional brain imaging data as they made technical judgments (outcome prediction, strategic appropriateness) about planned actions on partially completed tools. Results show that this task affected neural activity and functional connectivity in dorsal prefrontal cortex, that effect magnitude correlated with the frequency of correct strategic judgments, and that the frequency of correct strategic judgments was predictive of success in Acheulean, but not Oldowan, toolmaking. This corroborates hypothesized cognitive control demands of Acheulean toolmaking, specifically including information monitoring and manipulation functions attributed to the "central executive" of working memory. More broadly, it develops empirical methods for assessing the differential cognitive demands of Paleolithic technologies, and expands the scope of evolutionary hypotheses that can be tested using the available archaeological record.},

It shapes our minds and bodies and has provided a cumulative inheritance of knowledge, skills, institutions, and artifacts that allows us to truly stand on the shoulders of giants. No other species approaches the extent, diversity, and complexity of human culture, but we remain unsure how this came to be. The very uniqueness of human culture is both a puzzle and a problem. It is puzzling as to why more species have not adopted this manifestly beneficial strategy and problematic because the comparative methods of evolutionary biology are ill suited to explain unique events. Here, we develop a more particularistic and mechanistic evolutionary neuroscience approach to cumulative culture, taking into account experimental, developmental, comparative, and archaeological evidence. This approach reconciles currently competing accounts of the origins of human culture and develops the concept of a uniquely human technological niche rooted in a shared primate heritage of visuomotor coordination and dexterous manipulation.},

Acheulean variability includes a widely recognized increase in biface refinement from the Early to Late Acheulean, however the specific timing and technological nature of this shift remain unclear as do its behavioral, cognitive, and evolutionary implications. To investigate this topic, we examined lithic collections from the early Middle Pleistocene Acheulean site of Boxgrove for evidence of the use of platform preparation as a biface thinning technique. To aid in the identification and assessment of platform preparation, Boxgrove artifacts were compared with experimental products of Inexperienced, Novice, and Expert stone knappers. Results demonstrate the technologically efficacious use of platform preparation among the Boxgrove toolmakers w500 thousand years ago, providing the first direct evidence of this technique in the Acheulean. The use of platform preparation in bifacial thinning increases the complexity of toolmaking action sequences and has implications for understanding the neurocognitive substrates, social transmission, and spatiotemporal distribution of Late Acheulean technology.},

Evidence reviewed here supports the relevance of all three types of interaction and illustrates the contribution that detailed studies of archaeologically visible, technological behaviors, like stone knapping, can make to the study of human cognitive evolution. First, recent functional brain imaging studies of Lower Paleolithic tool making demonstrate an overlap with cortical language circuits that is consistent with motor hypotheses of speech and language origins. Second, ethnographic and developmental evidence highlights the role of joint attention and intentional communication in the social reproduction of both stone knapping and language skills. Finally, growing appreciation of the importance of hierarchical cognition\textemdash not simply in language but across domains of human action\textemdash is consistent with shared reliance on general information processing capacities.},

However, appropriate methods for describing and comparing Oldowan assemblages have yet to be agreed upon, and interpretation of the early record remains highly controversial. Particularly salient is disagreement over whether the Oldowan is a single technological phenomenon or is more accurately divided into multiple regional and/or chronological traditions, perhaps including a less developed Pre-Oldowan phase in the late Pliocene. Some of this disagreement reflects theoretical and methodological differences between research traditions and some is more directly evidential. Here we present a framework for describing and interpreting Oldowan variation and apply it to three Pliocene assemblages (EG-10, EG-12, and OGS-7) from Gona, all dated to c. 2.6 million years (Ma). Results indicate proficient knapping and a full range of Oldowan reduction strategies in these earliest known occurrences, consistent with the idea of an Oldowan ``technological stasis'' from 2.6\textendash 1.6 Ma. Patterns of variation in raw material selection and predominant reduction strategy at each site clearly indicate the importance of cultural transmission in the Oldowan, but confounding ecological and economic variation continue to render interpretation in terms of multiple tool making traditions or species inappropriate. We propose that cultural transmission and ecological adaptation should be recognized as complementary, rather than mutually exclusive, mechanisms in future attempts to explain Oldowan technological variation.},

However, appropriate methods for describing and comparing Oldowan assemblages have yet to be agreed upon, and interpretation of the early record remains highly controversial. Particularly salient is disagreement over whether the Oldowan is a single technological phenomenon or is more accurately divided into multiple regional and/or chronological traditions, perhaps including a less developed Pre-Oldowan phase in the late Pliocene. Some of this disagreement reflects theoretical and methodological differences between research traditions and some is more directly evidential. Here we present a framework for describing and interpreting Oldowan variation and apply it to three Pliocene assemblages (EG-10, EG-12, and OGS-7) from Gona, all dated to c. 2.6 million years (Ma). Results indicate proficient knapping and a full range of Oldowan reduction strategies in these earliest known occurrences, consistent with the idea of an Oldowan ``technological stasis'' from 2.6\textendash 1.6 Ma. Patterns of variation in raw material selection and predominant reduction strategy at each site clearly indicate the importance of cultural transmission in the Oldowan, but confounding ecological and economic variation continue to render interpretation in terms of multiple tool making traditions or species inappropriate. We propose that cultural transmission and ecological adaptation should be recognized as complementary, rather than mutually exclusive, mechanisms in future attempts to explain Oldowan technological variation.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a behavior-grounded approach to representing and learning the affordances of tools by a robot. The affordance representation is learned during a behavioral babbling stage in which the robot randomly chooses different exploratory behaviors, applies them to the tool, and observes their effects on environmental objects. As a result of this exploratory procedure, the tool representation is grounded in the behavioral and perceptual repertoire of the robot. Furthermore, the representation is autonomously testable and verifiable by the robot as it is expressed in concrete terms (i.e., behaviors) that are directly available to the robot's controller. The tool representation described here can also be used to solve tool-using tasks by dynamically sequencing the exploratory behaviors which were used to explore the tool based on their expected outcomes. The quality of the learned representation was tested on extension-of-reach tasks with rigid tools.},

  abstract = {Explanations for primate brain expansion and the evolution of human cognition and culture remain contentious despite extensive research. While multiple comparative analyses have investigated variation in brain size across primate species, very few have addressed why primates vary in how much they use social learning. Here, we evaluate the hypothesis that the enhanced reliance on socially transmitted behavior observed in some primates has coevolved with enlarged brains, complex sociality, and extended lifespans. Using recently developed phylogenetic comparative methods we show that, across primate species, a measure of social learning proclivity increases with absolute and relative brain volume, longevity (specifically reproductive lifespan), and social group size, correcting for research effort. We also confirm relationships of absolute and relative brain volume with longevity (both juvenile period and reproductive lifespan) and social group size, although longevity is generally the stronger predictor. Relationships between social learning, brain volume, and longevity remain when controlling for maternal investment and are therefore not simply explained as a by-product of the generally slower life history expected for larger brained species. Our findings suggest that both brain expansion and high reliance on culturally transmitted behavior coevolved with sociality and extended lifespan in primates. This coevolution is consistent with the hypothesis that the evolution of large brains, sociality, and long lifespans has promoted reliance on culture, with reliance on culture in turn driving further increases in brain volume, cognitive abilities, and lifespans in some primate lineages.},

  abstract = {The evaluation of competition, contingent on the identification of niche similarity, is a challenge in the fossil record. Specifically, a method for quantifying the degree of niche overlap is needed, as niches in paleocommunities can be reconstructed only using ecomorphological characters. In this study, I suggest the use of nonparametric multivariate pairwise comparisons for testing the presence or absence of niche overlap, wherein niches are defined as Hutchinsonian multidimensional hypervolumes. I applied this method to an extant mammalian guild, comprising primates and their dietary competitors, to determine the significance of dimensionality in niche construction and to examine the ability of molar morphology to capture dietary niche overlap. I conducted principal component analyses of eight molar measurements across all members of this guild, and dietary niches were defined by principal component scores. Niche overlap was assessed through the comparison of distances among individuals both within and between niches. To demonstrate the application of the proposed method, I compared dietary niches of 1) seven predefined dietary groups and 2) genera within and across dietary groups using multivariate pairwise comparisons. Results indicated that the typically unexplored higher principal components, or ``niche axes,'' may be integral to niche separation. As predicted, almost all niches of genera from different dietary groups did not overlap; however, niche overlap among genera within the same dietary category was less than expected. This highlights our need to investigate further the structure of niches within extant guilds to better inform our examination of competition in paleocommunities.},

With the bulk of the material dating to 45e39 ka cal BP (thousands of years calibrated before present), the Mughr el-Hamamah lithic artifacts reveal important differences from penecontemporaneous sites in the region, documenting greater technological variability than previously known for this time frame in the Levant. The radiocarbon data from this EUP archaeological context highlight remaining challenges for increasing chronological precision in documenting the MPeUP transition.},

Associated global population growth has depended on the biocultural evolution of positive elasticity in energy extraction rates, with respect to labor inputs. This article presents a statistical reanalysis of Keeley's cross-cultural data, documenting the niche-divergence between immediate-returns hunter-gatherers and delayed-returns, storage-dependent foragers. It is argued that the intricate relationships among niche elasticity, population-growth elasticity, niche diversification, and the biopolitics of inclusion and exclusion have dynamically shaped ecological enrichment\textemdash in the form of patch engineering\textemdash and demographic disruption\textemdash mainly in the form of dispersal, migration, raiding, and warfare.

            The systematic study of chipped stone debitage provides important information about prehistoric lithic technology. However, the results of most debitage analyses are unconvincing because of questionable assumptions and inherent flaws in the typologies used to classify the material. After briefly reviewing these problems, we present an alternative approach that does not rely on the presumed technological origins of individual artifacts as the basis for debitage classification and interpretation. An important element of this approach is a typology composed of interpretation-free and mutually exclusive debitage categories. The derivation of this typology is described and the utility of the approach is demonstrated with two Arizona case studies. The TEP St. Johns project provides new data and interpretations about Archaic Period technological and settlement changes while the Pitiful Flats study illustrates how differences in functional and organizational factors affect debitage assemblage variability.},

Journal of Archaeological Science 34, 1868\textendash 1877.] that explored the problem of taphonomic bias. Taphonomic bias refers to the tendency for younger things to be over-represented relative to older things in the archaeological record due to the operation of destructive processes like erosion and weathering. Using a database of radiocarbon dated volcanic deposits from Bryson, R.U., Bryson, R.A., Ruter, A. [2006. A calibrated radiocarbon database of late Quaternary volcanic eruptions. Earth Discussions 1, 123\textendash 124.], we develop an empirical model of taphonomic bias. In contrast to our prior study in which we modeled taphonomic bias as an exponential function wherein the likelihood of site loss remains constant through time, we argue that the probability of site destruction actually decreases with site age. We further demonstrate how this model can be used to correct temporal frequency distributions and extract demographic histories. We illustrate this approach using databases of radiocarbon dates from rockshelter and open-air sites in the Bighorn Basin, Wyoming, USA, and mammoths and humans in Siberia, Russia.},

  abstract = {Recent evaluation of the use of Pleistocene megafauna by Clovis hunter-gatherers has suggested that a small number of reliable associations between Clovis artifacts and the remains of Proboscideans are documented, with perhaps as few as 14 occurrences currently known. Specifically, we ask whether 14 is a large or a small number of associations given the spatio-temporal dimensions of the Clovis period in North America. To place these 14 occurrences into context, we compare the time\textendash space density and relative frequency of Clovis Proboscidean-bearing sites to those of Old World contexts. We develop models to identify the variables contributing to the archeological record of Proboscidean site creation, destruction, and sampling. While acknowledging potential biases in the record, comparative analysis suggests that the Clovis archeological record, with the possible exception of Lower Paleolithic of Iberia, indicates the highest frequency of subsistence exploitation of Proboscidea anywhere in the prehistoric world.},

The Talimbue site at Southeast Sulawesi is packed with lithic and these offer a new perspective on the lithic technology of Sulawesi. The absence of information on the prehistoric lithic technology of Southeast Sulawesi is a factor of interest that makes research on knowledge of the Talimbue site necessary. Lithic artefacts were manufactured from the terminal Pleistocene to the Late Holocene. This research will disentangle the details of the lithic technology at the Talimbue Site. The analyzed flaked stone artefacts fall into 3 categories, which are retouched flakes, debitage and cores. For its part, debitage was classified into 3 categories, which are complete flakes, broken flakes and debris. The retouch index was also measured so as to provide a quantitative estimate of the level of retouch intensity of the retouched flakes. The results of the analysis indicate changes in the stone flake technology during the period of occupation of the Talimbue Site. The change of technology occurs because the process of adaptation caused by a change of environment.},

Recent revision of the stratigraphy and chronology of this depositional sequence suggests that skeletal remains of H. floresiensis are between {$\sim$}100 and 60 ka old, while cultural evidence of this taxon occurs until {$\sim$}50 ka ago. Here we examine the compositions of the faunal communities and stone artifacts, by broad taxonomic groups and raw materials, throughout the {$\sim$}190 ka time interval preserved in the sequence. Major shifts are observed in both the faunal and stone artifact assemblages that reflect marked changes in paleoecology and hominin behavior, respectively. Our results suggest that H. floresiensis and Stegodon florensis insularis, along with giant marabou stork (Leptoptilos robustus) and vulture (Trigonoceps sp.), were likely extinct by {$\sim$}50 ka ago. Moreover, an abrupt and statistically significant shift in raw material preference due to an increased use of chert occurs {$\sim$}46 thousand calibrated radiocarbon (14C) years before present (ka cal. BP), a pattern that continues through the subsequent stratigraphic sequence. If an increased preference for chert does, in fact, characterize Homo sapiens assemblages at Liang Bua, as previous studies have suggested (e.g., Moore et al., 2009), then the shift observed here suggests that modern humans arrived on Flores by {$\sim$}46 ka cal. BP, which would be the earliest cultural evidence of modern humans in Indonesia.},

It is proposed that a proto-Takic group diverged from Northern Uto-Aztecan (NUA) by about 4,000 BP and that by about 3,500 BP, some of these people (the proto-Gab/Cupan) migrated south to occupy the Los Angeles/ Orange County region of coastal southern California, replacing the previous inhabitants, and became the Gabrielino. Sometime between about 1,500 and 1,000 BP, Takic languages diffused to the south and east and were adopted by neighboring Yuman peoples, who developed into the Serrano, Luise\~no, Cahuilla, and Cupe\~no.},

Understanding the spatial organisation, microstratigraphies, and the effects of cryogenic processes on the site formation is the basic presumption for lithic analysis at a large and complex site. Obviously, these extensive sites have a longer prehistory than was previously thought. The detection of the Early Upper Palaeolithic/Gravettian boundary was related to a radical change in the lithic raw material composition. The early and evolved Gravettian industries complete previously recorded the techno/typological spectrum by additional microlithic assemblages. With this new evidence, the paper also discusses the question of Gravettian origin.},

This paper reports the results of a survey of hilltops in the area and a subsequent GIS-based intervisibility analysis, which determined that a series of hilltop platforms in the region were ideally situated for fire-signaling purposes.

This is principally because the features of hunter-gatherer societies have been associated with discussions about the nature of human child rearing. However, few studies have empirically analyzed the education and learning that actually occur during the everyday life of the San. To reconsider several of the premises underpinning most approaches to human education and learning, I performed an interaction analysis of the mutual accommodation that occurs while caregivers and infants engage in nursing and ``gymnastic'' behaviors and the process by which children imitate each other during singing/dancing activities among the G|ui and G||ana (Central Kalahari San) living in Botswana. This analysis clarifies how participants in interactions align and affiliate with each other during culturally distinctive activities. These dynamics serve as a foundation for the education and learning that is inherent in collaboratively organized sequences of interactions, by means of which experienced and inexperienced people participate in social situations, such as those listed above. The approach adopted in this paper also facilitates reconsideration of the individualistic perspectives on ability.},

  abstract = {In this article we seek to build on efforts to apply the insights of social learning theory to interpret patterns of continuity and change in the archaeological record. This literature suggests that stable and often highly arbitrary material culture traditions are likely to be founded on our biologically evolved capacity for imitation. However, it has recently been argued that the latter may be insufficient to explain the long-term maintenance of complex and difficult-to-master skills, such as those required to produce stone tools, pots, textiles and other cognitively opaque cultural forms. To ensure that these skills are accurately transferred to the next generation, adults must actively guide and control the learning activities of their children, a mode of transmission that can be labelled `pedagogy'. The importance of pedagogy has often been overlooked in the theoretical and empirical literature on craft learning, a fact that can probably be attributed to an unnecessarily narrow conception of teaching that equates it with explicit linguistic instruction. Using ethnographic data gathered from detailed case studies, we characterize pedagogy in the context of craft apprenticeships as involving the gradual scaffolding of skill in a novice through demonstration, intervention and collaboration. Although these processes cannot be directly observed in the archaeological record, they can sometimes be inferred through the detailed reconstruction of operational chains in past technologies. The evidence we present suggests that pedagogy has played an essential role in securing the faithful transmission of skills across generations, and should be regarded as the central mechanism through which long-term and stable material culture traditions are propagated and maintained.},

  abstract = {The debate on the evolution of culture has focused on two processes in particular, phylogenesis and ethnogenesis. Recently, it has been suggested that the latter has probably always been more significant than the former. This proposal was assessed by applying cladistic methods of phylogenetic reconstruction to a data set comprising decorative characters from textiles produced by Turkmen tribes since the 18th century. The analyses focused on two periods in Turkmen history: the era in which most Turkmen practised nomadic pastoralism and were organised according to indigenous structures of affiliation and leadership; and the period following their defeat by Tsarist Russia in 1881, which is associated with the sedentarisation of nomadic Turkmen and their increasing dependence on the market. The results indicate that phylogenesis was the dominant process in the evolution of Turkmen carpet designs prior to the annexation of their territories, accounting for c.70\% of the resemblances among the woven assemblages. The analyses also show that phylogenesis was the dominant process after 1881, although ethnogenesis accounted for an additional 10\% of the resemblances among the assemblages. These results do not support the proposition that ethnogenesis has always been a more significant process in cultural evolution than phylogenesis.},

Over the last decade, this debate has intensified following the publication of a number of studies that have sought to reconstruct cultural histories using modern computational methods of phylogenetic analysis imported from biology. In this paper, I focus on evolution of tribal textile assemblages in Iran and Central Asia. Using cladistic phylogenetic analysis, I show that similarities and differences among the assemblages can be largely explained in terms of descent with modification from ancestral assemblages. Interestingly, the phylogenetic signal in design characters is just as strong (if not stronger) than the signal in technical characters. This may seem surprising given that techniques, like genes, are transmitted ``vertically'' from mothers to daughters whereas designs are frequently transmitted ``horizontally'' among peers. However, a closer examination reveals that the transmission of designs between weavers mainly occurs within, rather than between groups, and that, as in many cultures past and present, there are important constraints on the latter. This highlights that differences in the ways in which genes and cultural traits are transmitted among individuals should not be assumed to lead to differences in macro-level patterns of evolution, as many archaeologists and anthropologists have supposed.},

  abstract = {It is often assumed that parent-to-child cultural transmission leads to similarities and differences among groups evolving through descent with modification (``phylogenesis''). Similarly, cultural transmission between peers, and between adults and children who are not their offspring, is widely believed to result in groups exchanging cultural traits (``ethnogenesis''). However, neither of these assumptions has been examined empirically. Here, we test them using ethnographic data on craft learning in Iranian tribal populations and the cladistic method of phylogenetic analysis. We find that parent-to-child transmission dominates learning during childhood, but the other two forms of interindividual transmission become more important in later periods. The latter do not, however, appear to have resulted in extensive exchange of cultural traits among tribes. Instead we find that most of the variation among the tribes' craft assemblages can be explained by descent with modification. This can be accounted for by the fact that weavers usually only share their knowledge with members of their own tribe and are prevented from interacting with women from other groups by social norms. These findings demonstrate that the relationship between processes of cultural evolution at the level of the individual and processes of cultural evolution at the level of the group is more complex than is usually acknowledged, and highlight the need for more integrated studies of the processes operating at both scales.},

We also present a novel approach to quantitatively investigate some of the sociological theory surrounding the Provisional Irish Republican Army which challenges previously held assumptions concerning changes seen in the organisation. Finally, we extend our use of the Hawkes process model by considering a multidimensional version which permits both self and mutual-excitations. This allows us to test how the Provisional Irish Republican Army responded to past improvised explosive device attacks on different geographical scales from which we find evidence for the autonomy of the organisation over the six counties of NI and Belfast. By incorporating a second dataset concerning British Security Force (BSF) interventions, the multidimensional model allows us to test counter-terrorism (CT) operations in NI where we find subsequent increases in violence.},

Our mission in the RNMH project was to elucidate and compare the learning behaviors of modern humans and Neanderthals in order to test the ``learning hypothesis'' \textendash{} that modern humans' superior learning ability was the crucial factor in the replacement of Neanderthals by modern humans. Investigation was carried out into the learning behavior of modern huntergatherer children to discover the social, ecological, behavioral, and psychological factors that may ensure the fidelity of cultural transmission and expand opportunities for innovative behavior. What has become clear in the RNMH project is that it might be difficult to judge whether the biological differences in learning ability between the two species were the primary cause of the replacement, and that the experience of rapid environmental changes and new social environments that the sapiens faced as they became dispersed throughout Europe spurred them to develop new technologies and social relationships to cope with that difficulty. Although the data on Neanderthals' children were so little, some possible comparisons were made to get insights into the characteristics of learning behavior of sapiens and Neanderthals: (1) relationship between children's physical development and learning strategies; (2) changes in prevalent mode of cultural transmission according to physical development of children; (3) status of children in their groups; (4) the way of teaching that are usually embedded in every instance of social interaction and communication; (5) sociality and social networks that work for material, informational, and social exchanges in the same human groups. Social learning is one of the core drivers of human cultural evolution, and an understanding of the processes of learning and the contexts in which it occurs among contemporary hunter-gatherers can help us make sophisticated inferences about our past as well as provide clues about where we might be headed in the future.},

The contentious issue of global warming shows that when this happens, the seductive simplicity of most down-to-earth commonsense explanations can make it difficult for experts to win people over to the complexity and uncertainties of most scientific arguments. But sometimes scientists, too, succumb to the appeal of commonsense simplicity when they should not. As Fredrik Barth remarked, practically all social science reasoning rests on the premise that there are discrete groups of people that can be variously labeled ethnic groups, populations, societies, or cultures \textendash{} a commonsense idea that begs more questions than it resolves. Consider the case of the so-called Polynesians of the South Seas. Scholars have been accepting for centuries the claim that these islanders collectively comprise a biological and cultural people, or race, apart from other islanders in Oceania whose ancestors migrated long ago swiftly out into the Pacific more or less already recognizably `Polynesian' in their appearance, ways of speaking, and cultural practices from a homeland somewhere in Southeast Asia or on Formosa (Taiwan). Mounting convincing evidence to the contrary that can be widely accepted as defying such commonsense thinking has been and remains one of the greatest challenges to Pacific Island studies in the 21st century.},

Archaeological, zooarchaeological, and ancient DNA evidence combine to confirm the identification and context. The natural pre-Hispanic range of the Mexican turkey does not extend south of central Mexico, making the species non-local to the Maya area where another species, the ocellated turkey (Meleagris ocellata), is indigenous. Prior to this discovery, the earliest evidence of M. gallopavo in the Maya area dated to approximately one thousand years later. The El Mirador specimens therefore represent previously unrecorded Preclassic exchange of animals from northern Mesoamerica to the Maya cultural region. As the earliest evidence of M. gallopavo found outside its natural geographic range, the El Mirador turkeys also represent the earliest indirect evidence for Mesoamerican turkey rearing or domestication. The presence of male, female and sub-adult turkeys, and reduced flight morphology further suggests that the El Mirador turkeys were raised in captivity. This supports an argument for the origins of turkey husbandry or at least captive rearing in the Preclassic.},

As a consequence, there is growing interest in scientific reform. One such reform, direct replication, has emerged as a leading solution. Despite its importance, the focus on direct replication may divert attention from another problem plaguing the social sciences: lack of generalizability to the full range of human contexts. Here, we use our lab's recent cross-cultural study of social discounting to illustrate why developing broadly-applicable theories of human nature requires a complementary investment in generalizability. Social discounting is a repeatedly-documented and purportedly fundamental human tendency to sacrifice more for socially-close individuals. In our lab, we consistently document social discounting in U.S., MTurk, and college-student samples. However, when adapting a typical social discounting protocol to low-literacy and resource-scarce settings in Bangladesh and Indonesia, we find no independent effect of social distance on generosity, despite still documenting this effect among typical U.S. participants. Additionally, we document highlevels of ``inconsistent'' responding in Bangladesh and Indonesia. This finding strongly contrasts with current models of choice in various discounting literatures (e.g. social, probability, temporal, risk). These results highlight the need to complement current replication efforts with investment in strong checks on generalizability. By failing to do so, we risk developing theories of human nature that reliably explain behavior among only a thin slice of humanity.},

Information concerning the expansion of human groups into continental Southeast Asia is generally lacking \textemdash{} although fossil evidence demonstrating an early human presence in insular Southeast Asia does exist, i.e. Indonesia. A recent survey in Northern Thailand have produced a numerous series of stone tools which present an ideal opportunity for reconsidering the archaeological record of the Early Pleistocene in this region. We provide a preliminary description of the geomorphological context and a brief technological analysis of the stone tools from the site of Sao Din (Nan province). Technologically, this lithic assemblage presents the most similarities with southern Chinese assemblages dated between 1 Ma and 0.5 Ma.},

  abstract = {Molecular evidence indicates that the last common ancestor of the genus Pan and the hominin clade existed between 8 and 4 million years ago (Ma). The current fossil record indicates the Pan-Homo last common ancestor existed at least 5 Ma and most likely between 6 and 7 Ma. Together, the molecular and fossil evidence has important consequences for interpreting the evolutionary history of the hand within the tribe Hominini (hominins). Firstly, parsimony supports the hypothesis that the hand of the last common ancestor most likely resembled that of an extant great ape overall (Pan, Gorilla, and Pongo), and that of an African ape in particular. Second, it provides a context for interpreting the derived changes to the hand that have evolved in various hominins. For example, the Australopithecus afarensis hand is likely derived in comparison with that of the Pan\textendash Homo last common ancestor in having shorter fingers relative to thumb length and more proximo-distally oriented joints between its capitate, second metacarpal, and trapezium. This evidence suggests that these derived features evolved prior to the intensification of stone tool-related hominin behaviors beginning around 2.5 Ma. However, a majority of primitive features most likely present in the Pan-Homo last common ancestor are retained in the hands of Australopithecus, Paranthropus/early Homo, and Homo floresiensis. This evidence suggests that further derived changes to the hands of other hominins such as modern humans and Neandertals did not evolve until after 2.5 Ma and possibly even later than 1.5 Ma, which is currently the earliest evidence of Acheulian technology. The derived hands of modern humans and Neandertals may indicate a morphological commitment to tool-related manipulative behaviors beyond that observed in other hominins, including those (e.g. H. floresiensis) which may be descended from earlier tool-making species.},

Experimental trials consisted of an experimenter inducing one individual to look at food being displayed, and then observing the reaction of another individual (the subject) that was looking at that individual (not the food). Control trials consisted of an experimenter displaying the food in an identical manner when the subject was alone. Individuals from all species reliably followed the gaze of conspecifics, looking to the food about 80\% of the time in experimental trials, compared with about 20\% of the time in control trials. Results are discussed in terms of both the proximate mechanisms that might be involved and the adaptive functions that might be served by gaze-following.},

Classically, children come to understand beliefs, including false beliefs, at about 4\textendash 5 y of age, but recent studies using different response measures suggest that even infants (and apes!) have some skills as well. Resolving this discrepancy is not possible with current theories based on individual cognition. Instead, what is needed is an account recognizing that the key processes in constructing an understanding of belief are social and mental coordination with other persons and their (sometimes conflicting) perspectives. Engaging in such social and mental coordination involves species-unique skills and motivations of shared intentionality, especially as they are manifest in joint attention and linguistic communication, as well as sophisticated skills of executive function to coordinate the different perspectives involved. This shared intentionality account accords well with documented differences in the cognitive capacities of great apes and human children, and it explains why infants and apes pass some versions of false-belief tasks whereas only older children pass others.},

  abstract = {AND RECOMMENDATIONS In November 2010 the research team accepted an invitation from Hargy Oil Palms, Ltd. to visit a location near the new Barema mill where a large, highly worked obsidian tool had recently been uncovered by a bulldozer while leveling the ground surface for a house site (FADP). Collections made by HOPL employees and the team while searching the soil pushed off the terrace included fragments of at least 4 additional retouched artifacts that may be derived from stemmed tools together with a sample of small, non-cortical flakes. A study of two adjacent sections in the slope located directly above the bulldozed terrace identified the probable stratigraphic context for the stemmed tool. This is within a well developed soil that had formed on top of a late Pleistocene volcanic deposit that, in turn, had been sealed by a subsequent volcanic layer. Radiocarbon analysis of a small charcoal sample removed from this layer within Section 2 may provide a date for the artifact and for a stemmed artifact made from volcanic stone that was also recovered from the section. An archaeological excavation located near the top of the hill in undisturbed contexts might also yield data about the cultural context in which the stemmed tool was used and discarded. PXRF analysis determined that the stemmed tool and fragments were made using obsidian from sources in West New Britain. Additional study of the data collected should determine the obsidian source more precisely. A microscopic study of the stemmed tools found no usewear. This result provides important support for the hypothesis that these artifacts had a social and/or ritual function. A brief visit to the Barema mill site (FADQ) confirmed the presence of a light scatter of obsidian artifacts in the same stratigraphic context as the tools at the manager's house site (FADP). Study of a section below the Hargy Guest house identified a charcoal lens within a tephra level. Radiocarbon assay of this material may help date the stemmed tools and would contribute to a regional volcanic stratigraphy. A few obsidian flakes found on the surface near the section suggest the presence of ancient activity locally, probably on top of the hill (FADR). Future building activity should maintain a careful watching brief for archaeological finds.},

There has been growing interest in exploring systemicities in semantic change from a number of perspectives including theories of metaphor, pragmatic inferencing, and grammaticalization. Like earlier studies, these have for the most part been based on data taken out of context. This book is a detailed examination of semantic change from the perspective of historical pragmatics and discourse analysis. Drawing on extensive corpus data from over a thousand years of English and Japanese textual history, Traugott and Dasher show that most changes in meaning originate in and are motivated by the associative flow of speech and conceptual metonymy.},

Despite the historical importance of the region to these discussions, reliable chronologies for the nature, tempo, and timing of human behavioral changes seen among Middle Stone Age (MSA) and Later Stone Age (LSA) archaeological assemblages are sparse. The Kisese II rockshelter in the Kondoa region of Tanzania, originally excavated in 1956, preserves a ! 6-m-thick archaeological succession that spans the MSA/LSA transition, with lithic artifacts such as Levallois and bladelet cores and backed microliths, the recurrent use of red ochre, and {$>$}5,000 ostrich eggshell beads and bead fragments. Twenty-nine radiocarbon dates on ostrich eggshell carbonate make Kisese II one of the most robust chronological sequences for understanding archaeological change over the last \textasciitilde 47,000 years in East Africa. In particular, ostrich eggshell beads and backed microliths appear by 46\textendash 42 ka cal BP and occur throughout overlying Late Pleistocene and Holocene strata. Changes in lithic technology suggest an MSA/LSA transition that began 39\textendash 34.3 ka, with typical LSA technologies in place by the Last Glacial Maximum. The timing of these changes demonstrates the time-transgressive nature of behavioral innovations often linked to the origins of modern humans, even within a single region of Africa.},

  abstract = {Efforts to reconstruct the environmental context of human origins in 
eastern Africa often target deep lakes with high-resolution sedimentary
archives that can be re-analyzed for decades following recovery.
Lacustrine archives necessarily aggregate data across a relatively large
geographic area and can be difficult to integrate with direct
archaeological evidence for past human behavior, as foragers often used
micro-habitats not resolved in basin-scale approaches. We develop here
an alternative approach that pairs the record of past human behaviors
with paleoenvironmental data from locations where humans actually lived,
through new analyses of collections from the rockshelters at Kisese II
in northern Tanzania and GvJm22 at Lukenya Hill in southern Kenya. Just
like lake cores, curated archaeological collections represent a
'renewable resource,' and in this case we return to material excavated
{$>$}40 years ago. The sites are separated by 350 km, are found in
grassland settings today, and differ in elevation by 300 m. A suite of
55 AMS 14C dates indicates a 0-50 kyr span for both sites,
facilitating paired comparisons of temporal changes in (1) fossil fauna
taxonomic composition, (2) dental mesowear, (3) C and O isotopic
analyses of dentitions to assess changes in the local floral and faunal
communities, and (4) N isotopic analyses of ostrich eggshell to estimate
paleorainfall. Our preliminary results suggest concordance among the
different proxies for each site but indicate contrasting patterns of
paleoenvironmental change between them, with the Kisese II record
characterized by a relatively complex patterns of change relative to the
more persistent conditions recorded at Lukenya Hill. Despite these
differences in inferred paleoenvironments, both sites show a similar
pattern of intensive archaeological change, the Middle/Later Stone Age
transition, central to many discussions of the origin and geographic
range expansion of Homo sapiens. Our paleoenvironmental results derive
directly from archaeological sites, and the apparent lack of
correlations between paleoenvironmental and archaeological signals at
Kisese II and Lukenya Hill are difficult to reconcile with hypotheses
that suggest environmental change as a primary driver for the
Middle/Later Stone Age transition and human dispersals 50 ka.},

  abstract = {Southwest Asia is a key region in current debates surrounding the appearance of the first cultures attributed to anatomically modern humans, particularly the Aurignacian and preceding cultural units of the Iranian Zagros, Levant, and the Balkans (Baradostian, Ahmarien, Kozarnikien, etc.). The Zagros mountain range encompasses an immense territory that remains understudied with regard to the Upper Paleolithic as well as the first bladelet industries traditionally presumed to be the work of anatomically modern humans. Concerning the emergence of the Aurignacian, the sites of Warwasi rockshelter and Yafteh cave in the central Zagros are considered to show evidence of in situ evolution of the Upper Paleolithic from the local Mousterian. This hypothesis is tested by way of a taphonomic, technotypological and economic approach applied to the Upper Paleolithic levels of Warwasi (spits LLeAA) and Yafteh (the series from the lower part of the sequence). A comparison of the techno-economic features of both assemblages demonstrates a conceptual bond with contemporaneous technocomplexes from Levant and Europe (Ahmarian, Protoaurignacian, etc.). The techno-typological Middle Paleolithic character of the Warwasi lithic assemblage permits a discussion of a possible in situ dependence/continuum from the Mousterian or perhaps particular activities linked to the type of the occupation of the site. However, bladelet technology cannot be considered as rooted in the Zagros Mousterian. Consequently the origin of the Aurignacian sensu stricto has to be reconsidered.},

Here, the adoption of pottery by hunteregatherer communities marks the end of the Late Paleolithic and the beginning of the Initial Neolithic. The cultural environment in which pottery emerged can indicate whether the ceramic innovation arrived as part of a wider complex of new technologies and cultural characteristics, or whether it was incorporated into an already-existing cultural sphere. The paper investigates the development of lithic technology as one part of material culture at the PleistoceneeHolocene transition, concentrating on the primary reduction techniques. The study is based on data and material from the Krasnaya Gorka site, as well as published data from other sites of the Late Paleolithic and the Initial Neolithic. The comparative technological and typological analysis of the assemblages of the PleistoceneeHolocene transition reveals a continuity of lithic techniques, which is in accordance with the general tendency in most of North-East Asia. During the later stages of the Initial Neolithic, an innovation took place which is characterized by a further rationalization of the Yubetsu reduction technique, eventually leading to the microprismatic technique.},

This paper reviews theoretical approaches to resolving this puzzle. Our discussion integrates ideas and concepts from evolutionary biology, anthropology, and political science. The evolutionary framework of multilevel selection suggests that complex hierarchies can arise in response to selection imposed by intergroup conflict (warfare). The logical coherency of this theory has been investigated with mathematical models, and its predictions were tested empirically by constructing a database of the largest territorial states in the world (with the focus on the preindustrial era).},

These are long-standing questions that have proven difficult to answer. To test between competing hypotheses, we constructed a massive repository of historical and archaeological information known as ``Seshat: Global History Databank.'' We systematically coded data on 414 societies from 30 regions around the world spanning the last 10,000 years. We were able to capture information on 51 variables reflecting nine characteristics of human societies, such as social scale, economy, features of governance, and information systems. Our analyses revealed that these different characteristics show strong relationships with each other and that a single principal component captures around three-quarters of the observed variation. Furthermore, we found that different characteristics of social complexity are highly predictable across different world regions. These results suggest that key aspects of social organization are functionally related and do indeed coevolve in predictable ways. Our findings highlight the power of the sciences and humanities working together to rigorously test hypotheses about general rules that may have shaped human history.},

  abstract = {The main objective of this thesis was to understand the function, design and distribution of New Zealand adzes, aspects little studied in Polynesia as a whole. Methodology involved functional and manufacturing replication experiments and comparisons of these results with statistics derived from the analysis of almost 12,000 archaeological adzes. Methodology was guided by technological organization theory which states that technological strategies reflect human behaviours and that artefacts like adzes are physical manifestations of the strategies employed by people to overcome problems posed by environmental and resource conditions. Variability in adze morphology was discovered to be the outcome of ongoing technological adjustments to a range of conditions that were constrained by a set of functionally defined parameters. The nature of the raw material, both for the adzes themselves and to make them, had a major influence on adze technology and morphology within these functional parameters. Four basic functional adze types were identified fi-om distinct and consistent combinations of design attributes not previously recognized explicitly in previous adze typologies. It was found that design attributes previously considered significant like crosssection shape and butt reduction were more heavily influenced by raw material quality than functional specifications. It was also important to recognize that form and function changed over time with use, and because adzes were so valuable due to manufacturing costs, they were intensively curated. The majority of archaeological specimens studied for this thesis had seen major morphological and functional change. This dynamic was included ,in a typology based on 'adze state7 as findings suggested (1) that extending adze use-life and optimizing reworking potential was incorporated in initial design strategies, (2) that intensive curation may have played a major role in changes in adze morphology over time, and (3). that it had a major influence on distribution and discard patterns in the archaeological record. Having identified these influences on adze discard and distribution, two complex production and distribution networks were observed for the North Island based around Tahanga basalt and Nelson\textasciitilde Marlborough argillite. Each was complimentary to the other and involved other major and minor products and materials. Influential factors in the roles different settlements played in distribution included where people and raw materials were in relation to one another and the mode of transportation. The coastal location of early period settlements and important stone sources was an important aspect of these networks.},

The pattern of adze production is very similar to that found in New Zealand sites. No complete finished adzes were recovered, but the flake material indicates that Duff (1977) Types 1, 2, 3 and 4 were being made. Sourcing studies show that the basalt is local. Sourcing of obsidian shows that nearly all came from Raoul Island (Kermadecs) while one piece may be from New Zealand. Use wear and residues, notably starch grains, were found on many of the sample of 10 basalt and five obsidian artefacts analysed and the range of activities represented is congruent with a permanent or semi-permanent village rather than a temporary camp.},

The study draws attention to the importance of understanding both the costs and the benefits of technological investment and how they relate to one another. We use ethnographic and hypothetical data to demonstrate how one might represent these relationships mathematically, discuss the importance for understanding investment decisions, and explore their implications in circumstances where resources are randomly and non-randomly encountered.},

However, language and stone tool-making have so far only been studied separately using a range of neuroimaging techniques and diverse paradigms.
Methodology/Principal Findings: We present the first-ever study of brain activation that directly compares active Acheulean tool-making and language. Using functional transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (fTCD), we measured brain blood flow lateralization patterns (hemodynamics) in subjects who performed two tasks designed to isolate the planning component of Acheulean stone tool-making and cued word generation as a language task. We show highly correlated hemodynamics in the initial 10 seconds of task execution.
Conclusions/Significance: Stone tool-making and cued word generation cause common cerebral blood flow lateralization signatures in our participants. This is consistent with a shared neural substrate for prehistoric stone tool-making and language, and is compatible with language evolution theories that posit a co-evolution of language and manual praxis. In turn, our results support the hypothesis that aspects of language might have emerged as early as 1.75 million years ago, with the start of Acheulean technology.},

At Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, both industries are found within the same chronostratigraphic unit, the Lower Augitic Sandstone (LAS; 1.7 Ma), at HWK, HWK-E, HWK-EE (Oldowan) and FLK-W and FLK-N (Acheulean). Recently, McHenry and Stanistreet (2018) and Stanistreet et al. (2018) have argued that the Acheulean site of FLK West is actually located within a more recent stratigraphic unit, the Middle Augitic Sandstone (MAS). If so, the Acheulean could potentially have evolved from the Oldowan anagenetically. We test this hypothesis by reviewing the stratigraphy of the LAS from the HWK area to the FLK-W site. Hay's (1976) previous work stresses the continuity of the LAS from HWK-EE to FLK-NN, and stratigraphic and sedimentological evidence indicates that while the MAS has eroded away, the LAS is continuous throughout the study area. According to Hay (1976), Uribelarrea et al. (2017) and this work, the LAS is present at HWK-EE, HWK-E, HWK, HWK-W, FLK-S, FLK-W, FLK-N and FLK-NN. The emergence of the Acheulean at Olduvai Gorge ca. 1.7Ma and its coexistence with the Oldowan thus demonstrates a cladogenetic, rather than an anagenetic, origin for the Acheulean. This has implications for the behavioral and biological interpretations of the origin and co-existence of both types of industries.},

Here we argue that there is insufficient credible evidence in favor of or against this technological complexity thesis. For one thing, the few datasets that are available hardly constitute a representative sample. For another, they substantiate very specific, and usually different versions of the complexity thesis or, even worse, do not point to complexity increases.

  abstract = {Islands are at the frontline of the anthropogenic extinction crisis [1]. A vast number of island birds have gone extinct since human colonization [2], and an important proportion is currently threatened with extinction [3]. While the number of lost or threatened avian species has often been quantified [4], the macroevolutionary consequences of human impact on island biodiversity have rarely been measured [5]. Here, we estimate the amount of evolutionary time that has been lost or is under threat due to anthropogenic activity in a classic example, New Zealand. Half of its bird taxa have gone extinct since humans arrived [6, 7] and many are threatened [8], including lineages forming highly distinct branches in the avian tree of life [9\textendash 11]. Using paleontological and ancient DNA information, we compiled a dated phylogenetic dataset for New Zealand's terrestrial avifauna. We extend the method DAISIE developed for island biogeography [12] to allow for the fact that many of New Zealand's birds are evolutionarily isolated and use it to estimate natural rates of speciation, extinction, and colonization. Simulating under a range of human-induced extinction scenarios, we find that it would take approximately 50 million years (Ma) to recover the number of species lost since human colonization of New Zealand and up to 10 Ma to return to today's species numbers if currently threatened species go extinct. This study puts into macroevolutionary perspective the impact of humans in an isolated fauna and reveals how conservation decisions we take today will have repercussions for millions of years.},

In the current study, we present thermoluminescence (TL) dates obtained from 32 burnt flints retrieved from the late Lower Paleolithic (Acheulo-Yabrudian) and Early Middle Paleolithic (Mousterian) layers of Misliya Cave, Mount Carmel, Israel. Early Middle Paleolithic industries rich in Levallois and laminar products were assigned mean ages ranging from w250 to w160 ka (thousands of years ago), suggesting a production of this industry during MIS 7 and the early part of MIS 6. The mean ages obtained for the samples associated with the AcheuloYabrudian (strengthened by an isochron analysis) indicate a production of this cultural complex w250 ka ago, at the end of MIS 8. According to the Misliya TL dates, the transition from the Lower to the Middle Paleolithic in the site took place at the limit MIS 8/7 or during the early part of MIS 7. The dates, together with the pronounced differences in lithic technology strongly suggest the arrival of a new population during this period.},

  pages = {8},
  abstract = {South Africa's National Parks Board has opted to control African elephants (Loxodonta africana) through culling in the Kruger National Park (KNP). Killing elephants is highly controversial. The Board must balance this controversy against the probable destruction of vegetation and the consequent depletion of biological diversity that high elephant densities cause. Annual aerial counts provided the population estimates on which the culling quotas were based. For management purposes, the elephant population of the Park is divided into four sub-populations. From 1984 to 1994, the annual quota was usually taken from only one of these sub-populations during a given year. This resulted in 3 to 5 years elapsing between culls in each sub-population. We investigated the year-toyear changes in densities after culling. These changes were density dependent. Density dependence implies that immediate culls following estimated high densities may be premature. If left alone, the densities would decline naturally. Indeed, culling becomes self-reinforcing as it moves population densities towards the level where reproduction is greatest. Data confirm this intuition: at densities greater than 0.37 elephants/km2 elephant numbers generally declined without culling. Many culls were unnecessary. Culling, as implemented in the past, may have had consequences for elephants and their habitat that were different to those expected from a mere reduction in their numbers. Densities in the year immediately after a cull tended to decline \textendash{} not increase as would be expected from density dependence alone. Undoubtedly, this unexpected decline was the consequence of disturbance and subsequent emigration. In following years, the densities rose as animals moved back into the sub-population. A management programme where culling will be instituted only when densities exceed 0.37 elephants/km2 in selected regions in the park for at least 1 year, may be more acceptable than the programme used up to 1995. However, we do not know if the vegetation of KNP can withstand the resulting episodic high densities. With densities presently exceeding the cut-off values calculated for both the south and the northern management regions vegetation changes there need to be monitored.},

In contrast, we studied to what extent the most simple social influences on individual learning can support cultural inheritance. We did this using a spatial individual-based model where group foragers have to learn what to eat in a diverse patchy environment, and used simple population dynamics to investigate the potential of `merely living in groups' to allow for inheritance of diet traditions. Our results show that grouping by itself is a sufficient social influence on individual learning for supporting the inheritance of diet traditions. Unexpectedly, we find that grouping is also sufficient to generate cumulative group-level learning through which groups increase diet quality over the generations. Whether `traditions' or `progressive change' dominates depends on foraging selectivity. We show that these cultural phenomena can arise as side-effects of grouping and therefore independently of their adaptive consequences. This suggests that cultural phenomena could be quite general and shows that cumulative cultural processes already occur even for the most simple social influences on learning.},

However, their application on other continents, and particularly in the tropics, is hampered by uncertain equivalence with morphologically similar taxa in Europe, and incomplete knowledge of their ecology in the new local contexts. Here we use fossil NPP assemblages in a 25,000-year sediment record from Lake Challa, a steep-sided crater lake near Mt. Kilimanjaro in southeastern Kenya, to assess NPP diversity in a tropical-African context and the equivalence of African taxa with their European counterparts. We recovered a total of 65 well-defined NPP types, of which 61 are fungal spores, and 42 could be linked to known taxa. We provide diagnoses and illustrations of 61 recovered taxa, 58 of which have not been documented before. Using the Challa pollen record of past regional vegetation dynamics and two independent proxies of past temperature and rainfall, we also assessed the association of individual fungal taxa with particular species and biomes of tropical-African vegetation, and with the history of regional climate change. We often found strong correspondence between the stratigraphic distribution of individual fungal spore taxa and the occurrence of specific vegetation types. Changing climate conditions appear to have had a strong impact on the ability of fungi to play a role in the decomposition of dead plants. For fungal spore assemblages, the most prominent change in regional palaeoenvironments over the past 25,000years occurred at the start of the wet early Holocene, following Younger Dryas drought. Epicoccum purpurascens is common in the Glacial and Late-Glacial parts of the sequence, but shows a strong decline during the early Holocene. Coniochaeta cf. ligniaria occurs throughout the record but shows dramatic fluctuations that appear to relate to major changes in humidity. Correlation between fungal abundance and humidity is also observed in taxa for which the Challa region provided suitable habitat from ca. 16,500cal.yrBP (e.g., Curvularia) or from the Late-Glacial to Holocene transition (e.g., Tetraploa aristata, Dictyoarthrinium cf. sacchari, cf. Byssothecium, types HdV-1032 and HdV-1033, cf. Alternaria, cf. Brachysporium, cf. Helminthosporium, Spegazzinia tessarthra and cf. Lasiodiplodia theobromae). Many of these taxa did not occur, or were rare, during both wet and dry phases of the Glacial period, suggesting an additional temperature effect on their occurrence in tropical African environments. A possibly dominant role of temperature is revealed in the stratigraphic distribution of Acrodictys, which appears at the onset of deglacial climate warming ca. 17,500cal.yrBP and remains common throughout both wet and dry phases of the Holocene. Spores of the dung-inhabiting fungus Sporormiella occur throughout the 25,000-year record without notable fluctuations, suggesting little changes in the overall population density of large herbivores in the region.},

  abstract = {Objectives Common wisdom in paleoanthropology is that Neandertals had bigger brains than recent humans. Here we tested the hypothesis that there is no difference in brain size between Neandertals and recent humans while accounting for methodological variation and the makeup of both the Neandertal and recent human samples. Materials and Methods We examined endocranial volume (ECV) derived from virtually reconstructed endocasts of 11 Neandertals, six of which had associated femoral head diameters (FHD). Our recent human comparative dataset consisted of virtually measured ECV and associated FHD from 94 recent humans from the Robert J. Terry Anatomical Collection (63 male, 31 female). ECV of Neandertals and recent humans was compared using bootstrap resampling, repeating the analysis for two groupings of Neandertals (all and classic) and for three groupings of recent humans (all, males, and females). To examine brain size scaling, we completed an ordinary least squares regression of log (ECV) against log (FHD) for Neandertals and recent humans. Results The results of the bootstrap resampling analyses indicated that Neandertals only had significantly larger ECV when compared with recent human females. The regression between ECV and FHD suggested that Neandertals fall within the range of variation for larger humans. Discussion Our results demonstrate that Neandertals do not have uniquely large brains when compared with recent humans. Their brain size falls in the large end of the recent human range of variation, but does not exceed it. These results have implications for future research on Neandertal encephalization.},

  abstract = {Liang Bua, the type locality of Homo floresiensis, is a limestone cave located in the western part of the Indonesian island of Flores. The relatively continuous stratigraphic sequence of the site spans the past \textasciitilde 190 kyr and contains \textasciitilde 275,000 taxonomically identifiable vertebrate skeletal elements, \textasciitilde 80\% of which belong to murine rodent taxa (i.e., rats). Six described genera are present at Liang Bua (Papagomys, Spelaeomys, Hooijeromys, Komodomys, Paulamys, and Rattus), one of which, Hooijeromys, is newly recorded in the site deposits, being previously known only from Early to Middle Pleistocene sites in central Flores. Measurements of the proximal femur (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 10,212) and distal humerus (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1186) indicate five murine body size classes ranging from small (mouse-sized) to giant (common rabbit-sized) are present. The proportions of these five classes across successive stratigraphic units reveal two major changes in murine body size distribution due to significant shifts in the abundances of more open habitat-adapted medium-sized murines versus more closed habitatadapted smaller-sized ones. One of these changes suggests a modest increase in available open habitats occurred \textasciitilde 3 ka, likely the result of anthropogenic changes to the landscape related to farming by modern human populations. The other and more significant change occurred \textasciitilde 60 ka suggesting a rapid shift from more open habitats to more closed conditions at this time. The abrupt reduction of medium-sized murines, along with the disappearance of H. floresiensis, Stegodon florensis insularis (an extinct proboscidean), Varanus komodoensis (Komodo dragon), Leptoptilos robustus (giant marabou stork), and Trigonoceps sp. (vulture) at Liang Bua \textasciitilde 60e50 ka, is likely the consequence of these animals preferring and tracking more open habitats to elsewhere on the island. If correct, then the precise timing and nature of the extinction of H. floresiensis and its contemporaries must await new discoveries at Liang Bua or other as yet unexcavated sites on Flores.},

  abstract = {The purposeful production of small flakes is integral to the lithic variability of many Middle Pleistocene sites. Inhabitants of the Acheulo-Yabrudian site of Qesem Cave, Israel, systematically recycled `old' discarded blanks and tools, using them as cores for the production of small sharp tools with distinct technological features. These recycling end-products were produced in significant quantities throughout the human occupation of Qesem Cave, and their outstanding state of preservation made possible a functional analysis with residue detection using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX). An experimental program accompanying the study tested the efficiency of each tool category, and a reference collection of the organic remains was assembled. Our integrated results show that small flakes were used mainly to process soft to medium animal material through precise cutting activities that required accurate longitudinal motions. Several items show clear and exclusive contact with bone while others were used for designated steps in hide treatment processes. Plant and tuber processing are also evidenced although to a lesser extent. We show that the end products of recycling `old' flakes reflect preconceived technological and functional characteristics produced in a targeted manner to obtain specific tools designated for anticipated practical tasks. We demonstrate the complementary role of the products of recycling within the Qesem Cave toolkits alongside larger tools in assisting early humans in the different stages of processing animal materials. Moreover, use-wear and residue evidence indicates that Qesem hominins differentiated their activities across space in the cave. We argue that the meticulous realization of specific tasks and the deliberate, repetitive, and skilled production of tools of different sizes and shapes is one characteristic of the new mode of adaptation practiced by Acheulo-Yabrudian hominins in the Levant in order to better manipulate the available resources following the disappearance of mega-herbivores.},

Grass greenness estimates from ground surveys and aerial surveys were used to test the validity of the satellite imagery. Ground truthing suggested significant correlations with grass greenness estimates and NDVI in a portion of the Kalahari previously identified as the wildlife core area of the southern and central Kalahari. The results suggest that density distributions of some species were related to habitat greenness and the satellite imagery could be used to test habitat suitability for wildebeest, hartebeest and ostrich on a regional scale in the Kalahari. Results improved when livestock areas were excluded from the analysis, possibly because bush encroachment obscured the lower NDVI values expected as a result of heavy grazing.},

  abstract = {Abstract It has been suggested that many behavioral innovations, said to appear during the late Middle Stone Age in sub-Saharan Africa, facilitated the expansion of anatomically modern humans from Africa and the Near East into Europe at about 50 kyr; the process eventually led to the replacement of Neanderthals by modern humans and the emergence of the Upper Paleolithic. However, assemblages in this time range are little known in South Africa. In fact, the transition from Middle to the Later Stone Age in Southern Africa is controversial. The early appearance in South Africa of many innovations, such as sophisticated knapping techniques (e.g. the use of soft hammer or indirect percussion in blade production, of composite tools, of microlithic and bladelet technologies) remains to be established through technological analysis. We present here the first results of a project designed to carry out detailed technological studies of several lithic assemblages in South Africa and France dated to the transition period. At this time we have completed the study of a post-Howiesons Poort assemblage from the rock shelter site of Sibudu. The {$>$}2 m deep stratigraphic sequence of Sibudu extends from Howiesons Poort at its base to final Middle Stone Age, directly under Iron Age layers. We have analyzed in detail layer RSP (ca. 53 kyr, 1 m above the Howiesons Poort levels) which has provided a large assemblage of several thousand stone artifacts. Compared to published MSA assemblages this industry is unusual for the very high proportions of retouched pieces (15\%). The technology is not very elaborate and there is no strong standardization of the end-products. There are no flakes of predetermined shapes; retouch is used to modify irregular flakes to obtain desired edges. Knapping of flakes and blades is done by hard hammer; soft hammer is used only for retouching tools. Interestingly the older Howiesons Poort blades were produced on the same raw materials by soft hammer. Raw material (hornfels and dolerite) was procured from distances of less than 20 km. Unifacial points are the dominant type and there is strong evidence of hafting and use as spear armatures. Detailed comparisons with Middle Paleolithic assemblages of Western Europe show that the late Middle Stone Age technology in South Africa is very similar to that of the Middle Paleolithic; in fact we see no fundamental differences between the two entities, as far as lithic technology is concerned. Implications for the Out of Africa hypothesis are discussed.},

  abstract = {Excavated in 1949, Grotta dei Moscerini, dated MIS 5 to early MIS 4, is one of two Italian Neandertal sites with a large assemblage of retouched shells (n = 171) from 21 layers. The other occurrence is from the broadly contemporaneous layer L of Grotta del Cavallo in southern Italy (n = 126). Eight other Mousterian sites in Italy and one in Greece also have shell tools but in a very small number. The shell tools are made on valves of the smooth clam Callista chione. The general idea that the valves of Callista chione were collected by Neandertals on the beach after the death of the mollusk is incomplete. At Moscerini 23.9\% of the specimens were gathered directly from the sea floor as live animals by skin diving Neandertals. Archaeological data from sites in Italy, France and Spain confirm that shell fishing and fresh water fishing was a common activity of Neandertals, as indicated by anatomical studies recently published by E. Trinkaus. Lithic analysis provides data to show the relation between stone tools and shell tools. Several layers contain pumices derived from volcanic eruptions in the Ischia Island or the Campi Flegrei (prior to the Campanian Ignimbrite mega-eruption). Their rounded edges indicate that they were transported by sea currents to the beach at the base of the Moscerini sequence. Their presence in the occupation layers above the beach is discussed. The most plausible hypothesis is that they were collected by Neandertals. Incontrovertible evidence that Neandertals collected pumices is provided by a cave in Liguria. Use of pumices as abraders is well documented in the Upper Paleolithic. We prove that the exploitation of submerged aquatic resources and the collection of pumices common in the Upper Paleolithic were part of Neandertal behavior well before the arrival of modern humans in Western Europe.},

Location Lake Masoko, southern Tanzania (9\textdegree 20{${'}$} S, 33\textdegree 45{${'}$} E, 840 m a.s.l.). Methods Fossil pollen was extracted from a long and well-dated sedimentary sequence spanning the period 45,000\textendash 4400 cal. yr bp. The modern habitat, geographical distribution and climatic range (mean annual rainfall and temperature, and length of the dry season) of selected East African plants were used to infer past rainfall attributes for the most characteristic fossil pollen taxa identified from the sediments of Lake Masoko. Results In the Masoko pollen sequence it has been possible to identify changes in the length/severity of the dry season during the last 45,000 cal. yr bp, which are interpreted to reflect shifts in the mean position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) over the southern tropics. We suggest that this bioclimatic parameter has been the main driver of the vegetation dynamics in this area. The major inferred change occurred at the Younger Dryas\textendash Holocene transition c. 11,800 cal. yr bp, when semi-deciduous forest disappeared, being replaced in the lake catchment by woodland, which persists to the present day in spite of locally high rainfall. Main conclusions In tropical regions under the influence of the ITCZ, the position and strength of which determine the distribution of rainfall through the year, more attention must be paid to the impact of the length and intensity of the dry season on the modern and past distribution and dynamics of the vegetation. This climatic parameter is as important as the total annual amount of rainfall, and probably one of the most relevant in lowland areas.},

In lubilee there are high frequencies of standardized, curated artefacts and I interpret this as an aggregation camp assemblage. On the other hand, the expediently produced artefacts at Cave James are interpreted as a dispersal camp assemblage. I suggest, further, that some ofthe temporal variability in Later Stone Age assemblages can be explained by the aggregation and hxaro models. Shifting aggregation centres and the difftculty of aggregating in harsh environments would have affected both the distribution and character of Stone Age sites.},

Endogamous marriages among kin create intensive kinship systems with high group relatedness, while exogamous marriages among nonrelatives create extensive kinship with low group relatedness. Here, a sample of 58 societies (7,565 adults living in 353 residential groups) shows that average group relatedness is higher in lowland horticulturalists than in hunter\textendash gatherers. Higher relatedness in horticulturalists is remarkable given that village sizes are larger, harboring over twice the average number of adults than in hunter\textendash gatherer camps. The relatedness differential between subsistence regimes increases for larger group sizes. Large and dense networks of kin may have favored an increased propensity for some forms of in-group cooperation and political inequality that emerged relatively recently in human history, after the advent of farming.},

Intriguingly, ancient fossil hominins also exhibit substantial phalangeal curvature, which, too, has been interpreted as a direct result of habitual arboreality during life. Here, we describe the phalangeal curvature of a chimpanzee who was raised during the 1930s in New York City to live much like a human, including by having very few opportunities to engage in arboreal activities. We show that the degree of hand and foot phalangeal curvature in this individual is indistinguishable from that of wild chimpanzees and distinct from humans. Thus, rather than being a direct effect of mechanical loads produced by lifetime arboreal activities, phalangeal curvature appears to be shaped largely by genetic factors. An important implication of this finding is that phalangeal curvature among fossil hominins is evidently best interpreted as a primitive trait inherited from an arboreal ancestral species rather than proof of engagement in arboreal activities during life.},

The article analyses it drawing on philosophical discussions concerning the validity of inference from absence, using probabilistic models that were originally developed to show that such inferences are weak and inconclusive. The analysis reveals that inference from absence can indeed be justified in many important situations of archaeological research, such as excavations carried out to explore the past existence and time-span of sedentary human habitation. The justification is closely related to the fact that archaeology explores the human past via its material remains. The same analysis points to instances where inference from absence can have comparable validity in other historical sciences, and to research questions in which archaeological inference from absence will be problematic or totally unwarranted.},

These modelling techniques encompass the finite element method (FEM), extended finite element method (XFEM), discrete element method (DEM) and combined finite-discrete element method (FEM/DEM). This study investigates their inherent weaknesses and strengths for modelling the fracture and fragmentation process. A comparative review is first carried out to illustrate their fundamental principles as well as the advantages for the modelling of cracks, followed by the state-ofthe-art trial application in the example cases. An example of a glass beam subjected to low velocity hard body impact is examined as a plane stress problem. By evaluating the applicability of different models, the most desirable model for the entire dynamic fracture response is identified, and this is found to be the FEM/DEM. The FEM/DEM model is further examined by comparing results with the experimental data from high velocity and oblique impact tests. The study reveals that the FEM/DEM yields the most satisfactory results when modelling the dynamic fracture process of brittle materials such as glass.},

Recent discussion has centered on issues of comparability between handaxes from eastern Asian and `Acheulean' examples from western portions of the Old World. Here, we present a multivariate morphometric analysis in order to more fully document how Mid-Pleistocene (i.e. ,803 Kyr) handaxes from Bose Basin, China compare to examples from the west, as well as with additional (Mode 1) cores from across the Old World. Results show that handaxes from both the western Old World and Bose are significantly different from the Mode 1 cores, suggesting a gross comparability with regard to functionally-related form. Results also demonstrate overlap between the ranges of shape variation in Acheulean handaxes and those from Bose, demonstrating that neither raw material nor cognitive factors were an absolute impediment to Bose hominins in making comparable handaxe forms to their hominin kin west of the Movius Line. However, the shapes of western handaxes are different from the Bose examples to a statistically significant degree. Moreover, the handaxe assemblages from the western Old World are all more similar to each other than any individual assemblage is to the Bose handaxes. Variation in handaxe form is also comparatively high for the Bose material, consistent with suggestions that they represent an emergent, convergent instance of handaxe technology authored by Pleistocene hominins with cognitive capacities directly comparable to those of `Acheulean' hominins.},

Highway authorities have long been using road weather information systems (RWISs) to mitigate the risk of adverse weather on traffic. The data gathered, processed, and disseminated by such systems can improve both the safety of the traveling public as well as the effectiveness of winter road maintenance operations. As the road authorities continue to invest in expanding their existing RWIS networks, there is a growing need to determine the optimal deployment strategies for RWISs. To meet such demand, this study presents an innovative geostatistical approach to quantitatively analyze the spatiotemporal variations of the road weather and surface conditions. With help of constructed semivariograms, this study quantifies and examines both the spatial and temporal coverage of RWIS data. A case study of Alberta, which is one of the leaders in Canada in the use of RWISs, was conducted to indicate the reliability and applicability of the method proposed herein. The findings of this research offer insight for constructing a detailed spatiotemporal RWIS database to manage and deploy different types of RWISs, optimize winter road maintenance resources, and provide timely information on inclement road weather conditions for the traveling public.},

Here we collected soils from 54 sites along a 3700 km transect covering a wide range of grassland ecosystems with distinct aridity gradients. We quantified the bacterial community diversity and the effects of climate, edaphic parameter and geographic distance on the bacterial community structure using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Of the 35 phyla detected, 6 were dominant: Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Planctomycetes. Aridity was a major factor influencing bacterial diversity, community composition and taxon abundance. Although the pattern of bacterial species richness is markedly different from that of plant species richness, most soil bacteria were endemic to particular bioregions like macro-organisms. Community similarity significantly declined with environmental distance and geographic distance (r = -0.579 and -0.773, respectively). Geographic distance (historical contingencies) contributed more to bacterial community variation (36.02\%) than combined environmental factors (24.06\%). Overall, our results showed that geographic distance and climatic factors concurrently govern bacterial biogeographic patterns in arid and semi-arid grassland.},

This pattern, reaching at least as far back as the appearance of our species in the paleontological record, has left its traces in our genomes. Reconstructing a population's history from these traces is a challenging problem. Here we present a novel approach based on the Multiple Sequentially Markovian Coalescent (MSMC) to analyze the separation history between populations. Our approach, called MSMC-IM, uses an improved implementation of the MSMC (MSMC2) to estimate coalescence rates within and across pairs of populations, and then fits a continuous Isolation-Migration model to these rates to obtain a time-dependent estimate of gene flow. We show, using simulations, that our method can identify complex demographic scenarios involving post-split admixture or archaic introgression. We apply MSMC-IM to whole genome sequences from 15 worldwide populations, tracking the process of human genetic diversification. We detect traces of extremely deep ancestry between some African populations, with around 1\% of ancestry dating to divergences older than a million years ago.},

These questions are driven by the paucity of hand fossils in the hominin fossil record between 800,000 and 1.8 My old, a time interval well documented for the emergence and subsequent proliferation of Acheulian technology (shaped bifacial stone tools). Modern and Middle to Late Pleistocene humans share a suite of derived features in the thumb, wrist, and radial carpometacarpal joints that is noticeably absent in early hominins. Here we show that one of the most distinctive features of this suite in the Middle Pleistocene to recent human hand, the third metacarpal styloid process, was present {$\sim$}1.42 Mya in an East African hominin from Kaitio, West Turkana, Kenya. This fossil thus provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key shared derived characteristic of modern human and Neandertal hand morphology and suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato.},

  abstract = {This paper postulates that cultural entities with long term structural integrity are characterized by symmetrical relationships between and among the constituent sectors of society. We demonstrate how such social relationships are embedded in the symmetrical arrangements of motifs in geometric design. We test this premise with an analysis of 1000 years of ceramic design from the northern American Southwest, AD 600-1600, with a description of the continuities and changes in the plane pattern symmetries that structure design. Two major points of change in symmetry use at c. AD 900 and AD 1300 correlate with changes in settlement type from pithouses to unit pueblos and from unit pueblos to multi-storied plaza oriented pueblos that accompanied adjustments to changes in environmental conditions. We propose that in the American Southwest the predominant use of bifold symmetry is a structural metaphor for the reciprocal social relationships basic to the organization of small puebloan agricultural communities and that the changes in these symmetries reflect the changing integration of the household into an increasingly complex social system. This interpretation of the meaning of design structure is derived from cosmological principles embedded in 20th century ritual songs of the Hopi, descendents of the prehistoric puebloans, as well as depicted in images in their 15th century kiva wall murals. We present this interpretation of the sequence of pueblo development in the American Southwest in terms of the changing symmetrical nature of the social relationships that integrated the agricultural communities as an example of the insights possible with this new approach to design analysis. Este art\'iculo postula que entidades culturales con integridad estructural a largo plazo observables en el registro arqueol\'ogico est\'an caracterizadas por relaciones de simetr\'ia entre y en medio de los sectores constituyentes de la sociedad. Hemos demostrado como tales relaciones sociales est\'an presentes en las ordenaciones sim\'etricas de motivos en el dise\~no geom\'etrico. Hemos evaluado esta premisa con un an\'alisis de 1,000 a\~nos de dise\~nos cer\'amicos del norte del Suroeste Americano, 600\textendash 1600 d. C., con una descripci\'on de las continuidades y cambios en los patrones de simetr\'ia planares que dan estructura a los dise\~nos. Dos puntos mayores de cambio en usos de simetr\'ia hacia los a\~nos 900 d. C. y 1300 d. C. est\'an correlacionados con cambios en tipos de asentamientos de casas-pozo a unidades pueblos y de unidades pueblos a pueblos organizados en plazas con m\'ultiples niveles que, a su vez, acompa\~no a ajustes por cambios en condiciones ambientales. Proponemos que en el Suroeste Americano el uso predominante de simetr\'ia bifold es una met\'afora estructural por las relaciones sociales rec\'iprocas b\'asicas para la organizaci\'on de peque\~nas comunidades agr\'icolas de indios pueblo y que los cambios en la simetr\'ia bifold refleja la integraci\'on cambiante de la familia en un sistema social cada vez m\'as complejo. Esta interpretaci\'on del significado de la estructura del dise\~no est\'a derivado de principios cosmol\'ogicos presentes en cantos rituales del siglo 20 de los Hopi, descendientes de indios pueblo prehist\'oricos, as\'i como se muestra en im\'agenes en sus murales en las paredes de los kiva del siglo 15. Presentamos esta interpretaci\'on de la secuencia del desarrollo pueblo en el Suroeste Americano en t\'erminos de la naturaleza cambiante de las simetr\'ias de las relaciones sociales que integraron las comunidades agr\'icolas como un ejemplar de las clases de nociones posibles con este nuevo planteamiento al an\'alisis de dise\~no.},

  abstract = {Some 13,000 years ago, humans were drawn repeatedly to a small valley in what is now Central Texas, near the banks of Buttermilk Creek. These early hunter-gatherers camped, collected stone, and shaped it into a variety of tools they needed to hunt game, process food, and subsist in the Texas wilderness. Their toolkit included bifaces, blades, and deadly spear points. Where they worked, they left thousands of pieces of debris, which have allowed archaeologists to reconstruct their methods of tool production. Along with the faunal material that was also discarded in their prehistoric campsite, these stone, or lithic, artifacts afford a glimpse of human life at the end of the last ice age during an era referred to as Clovis.The area where these people roamed and camped, called the Gault site, is one of the most important Clovis sites in North America. A decade ago a team from Texas A\&M University excavated a single area of the site\textemdash formally named Excavation Area 8, but informally dubbed the Lindsey Pit\textemdash which features the densest concentration of Clovis artifacts and the clearest stratigraphy at the Gault site.

Both sites contain significant Clovis horizons and the Topper site is reported to contain a pre-Clovis assemblage characterized by a smashed core and microlithic industry. The stratigraphic position of the early assemblage at Topper is indeed below Clovis and radiocarbon and luminescence ages support its preClovis age. However, the human origin of the proposed artifacts has not been conclusively proven. The late Quaternary stratigraphic sequence developed for this segment of the Savannah River provides support for a regional pattern of river metamorphosis over the last 50,000 years in southeastern U.S. streams.},

This was the first site to provide evidence of a late Pleistocene occupation of South America, and it is the site where the Fishtail projectile point type was defined. Previous radiocarbon ages from Fell's Cave on charcoal samples from three hearths in the late Pleistocene artifact-bearing levels yielded dates ranging from ca. 11,000 to 10,100 radiocarbon years before present. New radiocarbon dates on curated charcoal samples from these same hearths yield revised ages of ca. 10,800 to 10,400 radiocarbon years before present.

  abstract = {Archaeological analyses of European lithic technologies in North America are often discussed anecdotally within the context of other material evidence of European occupations. In North America, the presence of gunflints manufactured in Europe, generally England (which became part of Great Britain in 1707) or France, is used as a marker for the influence of these European powers and as a reflection of from whom residents obtained their material culture. Gunflints were made in Europe and in North America (north of the Rio Grande) from the early 1600s to the late 1800s. Thus, gunflints from sites such as the Natchez Fort, Louisiana (AD 1729\textendash 1731) provide a unique avenue of analysis for understanding both continuity in lithic technologies and the interactions between indigenous and introduced technologies. We address methodological concerns in typifying historic lithic collections, specifically eighteenth-century gunflints, particularly as these concern sourcing and the implications of sourcing for eighteenth-century colonial interactions in the southeastern United States.},

New analytical methods were then used to investigate individual flintknappers' participation in the community organization of the prehistoric eastern Tonto Basin, Arizona. Specifically, small triangular stone projectile points (n = 149) collected from Roosevelt phase (A.D. 1275\textendash 1325) sites were analyzed to inform an assessment of the spatial distribution of individuals' handiwork in late prehistoric multi-site settlements. This research illustrates how improved individual-scale techniques may provide new insight on topics of considerable interest to archaeologists.

The first megafaunal extinctions in New Zealand began just 700 years ago, in contrast to the deep time of continental extinctions. Consequently, indigenous M\=aori oral tradition includes ancestral sayings that explicitly refer to extinct species. Our linguistic analysis of these sayings shows a strong bias towards critical food species such as moa, and emphasizes that M\=aori closely observed the fauna and environment. Temporal changes in form and content demonstrate that M\=aori recognized the loss of important animal resources, and that this loss reverberated culturally centuries later. The data provide evidence that extinction of keystone fauna was important for shaping ecological and social thought in M\=aori society, and suggest a similar role in other early societies that lived through megafaunal extinction events.},

settlement may have been as early as the 8th century AD for the uplifted limestone island
of Henderson, the most pristine island of its kind. An archaeological survey of the Pitcairn
Islands is provided, while Henderson is examined in detail. Recent extensive excavations
provide a record of change during 600 years of human occupation. Adaptation to the
ecologically-marginal conditions is documented by artefacts, more than 150 000 vertebrate
bones, molluscs and subfossil plant remains recovered from stratigraphic contexts. The effects
of prehistoric human occupation on the pristine environment are revealed by Polynesian
plant and animal introductions, bird extinctions and range reductions, possible over-predation
of marine molluscs, exploitation of sea turtles, and large-scale burning for swidden agriculture.
The origin of human colonists is documented by analysing imported artefacts by geochemical
characterization (x-ray fluorescence analysis). The human abandonment of Henderson, by the
seventeenth century, is viewed in the context of prehistoric regional dynamics.},

We defined the approximate limits of the quarry complex, located the in situ geological source of the fine-grained basalt used for adze manufacture, report the petrographic and geochemical variability of the source rock, and describe the adze reduction strategies from analysis of adze blanks and preforms, as well as hammerstones and debitage. The geochemical variation of the nine source rocks and artefacts were defined by a comprehensive array of 10 fully quantitative major element concentrations, 43 trace element abundances, and high-precision Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic ratios obtained using the state-of-the-art Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry (TIMS, for Sr isotopes), Multi-Collector Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS, for Nd-Pb isotopes), quadrupole ICP-MS (for trace elements) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES, for major elements), respectively. A piece of branch coral was recovered from the surface of a rockshelter that provided a U-series date of possible quarry use in the mid-13th century.

  abstract = {Polynesian stone adze quarries anchor the system of tool production, distribution and consumption and are critical for examining changing social organization, symbolic values attributed to particular stone sources, economic intensification and ancient interaction. Although major adze quarries are known from most Polynesian archipelagos, a geologically informed archaeological survey was designed for discovering the variability in stone-tool-quality rock sources. Thirteen quarries and sources within the {$\sim$}20,000 hectare traditional land unit of Kaluako`i (literally, the adze pit) on Moloka`i, Hawaiian Islands, vary considerably in size, production output and settlement context, suggesting that individual adze quarries were accorded different roles across the social landscape. Some sixty-four radiocarbon age determinations and U-series dates from quarries and habitation sites with artefacts originating from quarries, document the temporal sequence of use beginning in the Late Expansion Period (ad 1400\textendash 1650), at least two centuries after settlement of the island. Further studies will report on adze technology and on-going geochemical sourcing analyses.},

More than 65 years after he visited the largest adze quarry on the island al Kapohaku, this important adze production cenire was relocated, and a surface collection of flakes, adze blanks and preforms was made. The assemblage is described and a reduction sequence is proposed for the production of adzes from flakes. Technological comparisons with other adze quarries in Polynesia suggest Polynesian-wide similarities in the production of flake adzes.

  abstract = {The late Middle Paleolithic in central and eastern Europe is defined by the presence or absence of certain bifacial tools and blank production methods. Hence, the assemblages between MIS 5a and MIS 3 are classified as Mousterian, Taubachian, Micoquian, Micoquo-Prondnikien, Pra\k{}dnik cycle and Keilmessergruppen, among others. We like to address here the questions of what do these assemblages look like when the type fossils (``fossil directeur'') are set aside and what are the main drivers of variability within and between these assemblages. Therefore, we analyzed nine assemblages of four late Middle Paleolithic open-air sites of the European Plain: Pouch and Ko\texteuro nigsaue for central Germany, Wroc\l aw-Hallera Av. for southwestern Poland and Khotylevo I-6-2 for western Russia. Our study is based on an attribute analysis of flakes, as they are the most numerous artifact type in the lithic assemblages, bearing traces of the flaking technology in their morphology. Linear and nonlinear multivariate statistical analyses of the flake attributes show similar patterns for the assemblages and show no distinctions between Mousterian and Micoquian assemblages aside from the type fossils. Additionally, assemblage variability is, except for one case, not site specific or regional. The analysis of the factors that drive within and between assemblage variability revealed that the assemblages are influenced by site preservation, raw material size and economy, as well as similar blank production and tool manufacture methods that are present in varying degrees in each assemblage. In other words, taking into account site preservation, the overall character of these late Middle Paleolithic assemblages primarily reflects the flexible application of late Neanderthal flaking and tool production methods to the local raw material constraints. Once the type fossils are removed, these assemblages represent a range of variability that cannot be grouped readily into named archaeological entities that could represent distinct human groups.},

Excavations show evidence for growth and remodeling of the site's public and domestic spaces over its short use life as a doctrina, pointing to an increasingly orthodox regime of indoctrination. The results of SNA-based walking simulations show specifically how movement through the site was rerouted to isolate the old Inka ceremonial core, producing new rhythms of interaction and directing public processionals to the colonial plaza and chapel of the doctrina. The complementarity of SNA with other established forms of access analysis and its broader utility for archaeological research design, sampling strategies, hypothesis testing, and interpretation are discussed.},

Review of the chronology for Mode 3, including Levallois, suggests independent discovery of these techniques at different times in different places, although sometimes a regional development of stone-working can be identified. Despite instances of Mode 3-type technologies associated with Oldowan industries as early as 1.5 Ma, the origin for all other Mode 3 technologies is regarded as being firmly embedded in the Acheulian through the merging of `debitage' and `fa\c{c}onnage'. In Europe, the fusion of these techniques emerges from Marine Isotope Stage 9.},

Documentary sources are assembled in order to provide sufficient controls for experimental replication of fireflints which could lead to classification. Gunflints represent a unique situation, because they were a reapplication of ancient fire and steel techniques for the ignition of firearms. With antecedents in prehistoric times, fireflints became critical munitions items during the flintlock era, in addition to domestic fire production. With the coming of the industrial age, gunflints retained their importance by switching to worldwide colonial markets during the later 19th and early 20th centuries. In effect a fragmentary ''time capsulen has been preserved concerning the working of lithic materials . The economic history of French gunflint making can only be presented in outline form, because of the difficulties in obtaining information. Fortunately, the tools and manufacturing processes can be compared and contrasted, including available information for other ``recent" flintworking. It is hoped that this paper can be useful for creating replicated decision model types for future experimentation relating to Bonnichsen's (1973) 5 overlapping levels of input and output attributes.},

  abstract = {We describe our recent studies of imitation and cultural transmission in chimpanzees and children, which question late twentieth-century characterizations of children as imitators, but chimpanzees as emulators. As emulation entails learning only about the results of others' actions, it has been thought to curtail any capacity to sustain cultures. Recent chimpanzee diffusion experiments have by contrast documented a significant capacity for copying local behavioural traditions. Additionally, in recent `ghost' experiments with no model visible, chimpanzees failed to replicate the object movements on which emulation is supposed to focus. We conclude that chimpanzees rely more on imitation and have greater cultural capacities than previously acknowledged. However, we also find that they selectively apply a range of social learning processes that include emulation. Recent studies demonstrating surprisingly unselective `over-imitation' in children suggest that children's propensity to imitate has been underestimated too. We discuss the implications of these developments for the nature of social learning and culture in the two species. Finally, our new experiments directly address cumulative cultural learning. Initial results demonstrate a relative conservatism and conformity in chimpanzees' learning, contrasting with cumulative cultural learning in young children. This difference may contribute much to the contrast in these species' capacities for cultural evolution.},

  abstract = {The significance of morphological variation in Acheulean bifaces has been a central issue in Palaeolithic research for well over a century. For much of that period interpretation has been dominated by culture-historical models and it is only in the past 20 years that other explanatory factors have received adequate attention. This paper examines the combined role of several of these factors \textendash{} namely raw materials, reduction intensity, and function \textendash{} on biface variability in the British Isles, with special reference to the two major shaped-based `tradition' devised by Roe (1967; 1968). First-hand examination of bifaces from 19 assemblages suggests that final biface shape depends largely on the dimensions of the original raw materials and the technofunctional strategies designed to deal with them. Through these observations a new model is generated and tested. This suggests that the patterning in the British Acheulean simply reflects the nature of the resources available at a site and the hominid procurement and technological strategies used to exploit them. According to this model, well-worked ovates with all-round edges were preferentially produced wherever raw materials were large and robust enough to frequently support intensive reduction procedures, usually when obtained from primary flint sources. Assemblages characterised by partially-edged, moderately-reduced pointed forms were only manufactured when smaller, narrower blanks, that imposed restrictions on human technological actions regarding the location and extent of working, were exploited. Such blanks were usually obtained from a secondary flint source, such as river gravel. Thus, Roe's pointed and ovate `traditions' are seen not as the products of different biface making populations, but as the same broad populations coping with the exigencies of a heterogeneous environment, using different resources in an adaptive, flexible manner., La signification de la variation morphologique dans les bifaces acheul\'eens est au centre d'une discussion dans les recherches pal\'eolithiques depuis plus d'un si\`ecle. Pendant la plupart de ce temps l'interpr\'etation est domin\'ee par des mod\`eles socio-culturels et ce n'est que pendant les vingt derniers ans que d'autres moyens d'explication re\c{c}oivent l'attention qu'ils m\'eritent. Cet article examine le r\^ole commun que jouent plusieurs d'entre ces moyens \textendash{} c'est-\`a-dire les mati\`eres premi\`eres, l'intensit\'e de r\'eduction et la fonction - sur la variabilit\'e des bifaces dans les \^iles britanniques, en mettant l'accent sur les deux plus grandes ``traditions`` bas\'ees sur la forme et \'etablies par Roe (1967; 1968). Les analyses \`a premi\`ere main des bifaces de 19 assemblages indiquent que la forme finale des bifaces d\'epend principalement des dimensions des mati\`eres premi\`eres d'origine et des strat\'egies techno-fonctionnelles vis\'ees \`a s'en servir. Par moyen de ces observations un nouveau mod\`ele est \'etabli et mis \`a l'\'epreuve. Ceci indique que le dessin pendant l'acheul\'een britannique ne fait qu'exprimer la nature des ressources pr\'esentes sur place et leur procuration par les hominiens et les strat\'egies technologiques employ\'ees pour les exploiter. Selon ce mod\`ele, des ovates bien taill\'ees \`a c\^ot\'es bien arrondis \'etaient produites de pr\'ef\'erence partout l\`a o\`u les mati\`eres premi\`eres \'etaient assez grandes et robustes pour entretenir fr\'equemment les proc\'ed\'es de la r\'eduction intensive, d'habitude quand elles venaient de sources primaires de silex. Les assemblages caract\'eris\'es par les formes \`a c\^ot\'es partiels et \`a pointes mod\'er\'ement r\'eduites \'etaient fabriqu\'es seulement dans le cas o\`u l'on exploitait de plus petites, plus \'etroites bases qui imposaient des restrictions sur les actions technologiques humaines en ce qui concerne la location et l'\'etendue de l'exploitation. Telles bases \'etaient normalement obtenues d'une source secondaire de silex, par exemple du gravier fluvial. Ainsi, les traditions pointues et ovates de Roe ne se pr\'esentent pas comme des produits de diff\'erentes populations qui fabriquaient les bifaces mais des m\^emes populations g\'en\'erales qui se d\'ebrouillaient avec les exigences d'un milieu h\'et\'erog\`ene en utilisant divers ressources d'une mani\`ere adaptive et flexible., Die Bedeutung der morphologischen Variietheit der acheule\'en doppelseitigen Werkzeuge war mehr als ein Jahrhundert lang ein Hauptthema in der pal\"aolithischen Forschung. Fast w\"ahrend der ganzen Periode wurde die Interpretation von kulturhistorischen Modellen dominiert. Nur in den letzten zwanzig Jahren haben andere aufkl\"arende Faktoren gen\"ugend Aufmerksamkeit erhalten. Dieses Referat \"uberpr\"uft die gemeinsame Rolle einiger dieser Faktoren - namentlich Rohstoffe, reduzierte Intensit\"at und Funktionen \textendash{} die bei der Variiertheit doppelseitiger Werkzeuge auf den Britischen Inseln eine Rolle spielten, insbesondere die, welche auf zwei bedeutende, auf Formen basierte `Traditionen' hinweist und die von Roe 1967/68 erfunden wurde. Aus erster Hand gemachte Untersuchungen der Werkzeuge aus neunzehn Assemblagen weisen darauf hin, dass die endg\"ultige doppelseitige Form zum gr\"o\ss ten Teil von den Dimensionen der Rohmaterialien und dem technisch funktionierenden System mit den Werkzeugen zu Rande zu kommen, abhing. Durch diese Beobachtungen ist ein neues Modell entstanden und gepr\"uft worden. Dies wiederum weist darauf hin, dass ein Mustervorbild in der britischen Acheuleen-Periode einfach nur die Begebenheit dieser auf diesem Gel\"ande verf\"ugbaren Rohmaterialien und deren urspr\"ungliche Herschaffung und ihre technologischen Strategien, diese Rohmaterialien auszun\"utzen, reflektiert. Nach diesem Modell wurden dort gut verarbeitete `Ovate' mit rundgeformten R\"andern mit Vorliebe produziert, wo Rohmaterialien in Gen\"uge vorkamen und ziemlich robust waren, um oft intensive Reduktionsprozeduren, gew\"ohnlich wenn diese Rohmaterialien bei prim\"aren Feuersteinstellen gefunden wurden, zu unterst\"utzen. Assemblagen, die sich durch teilweis ger\"anderte, m\"a\ss ig reduzierte, gespitzte Formen auszeichneten, wurden nur dann hergestellt, wenn schm\"alere enge Abschlage die Einschr\"ankungen auf menschliches technologisches Handeln bez\"uglich des Ortes und Ausma\ss es der Verarbeitung auferlegten, ausgenutzt. Solche Abschlage wurden gew\"ohnlich bei sekund\"aren Feuersteinfundstellen, wie zum Beispiel Flusskies, gefunden. Deshalb sollen Roes gespitzte und Ovate `Traditionen' nicht als Produkte verschiedener V\"olker, die doppelseitige Werkzeuge herstellten, angesehen werden, sondern als die der gleichen Bev\"olkerung, die mit den Anforderungen einer heterogenen Umwelt verschiedener Natursch\"atzen in einer adaptiven, flexiblen Weise n\"utzend, fertig zu werden., La transcendencia de la variabilidad morfol\'ogica de los bifaces achelenses, ha constituido un tema central de las investigaciones sobre el Paleol\'itico a lo largo de m\'as de un siglo. Durante la mayor parte de este periodo, las interpretaciones han sido predominantemente del tipo hist\'orico-cultural. Solamente en los \'ultimos veinte a\~nos, otros factores explicativos han recibido atenci\'on adecuada. Este trabajo examina el papel desempe\~nado por la combinaci\'on de varios de estos factores (disponibilidad de materias primas, intensidad de su reducci\'on, y su utilizaci\'on), en la variabilidad de los bifaces de las Islas Brit\'anicas, con especial atenci\'on a las dos mayores ``tradiciones'' morfol\'ogicas definidas por Roe (1967; 1968). Un examen de primera mano de bifaces provenientes de 19 colecciones, parece indicar que la forma final del bif\'az depende en gran parte de las dimensiones del material originalmente utilizado y de las estrategias t\'ecnico-funcionales escogidas para trabajarlo. A trav\'es de estas observaciones se propone y comprueba un nuevo modelo. Este modelo sugiere que la estructura del achelense brit\'anico simplemente refleja la naturaleza de los recursos disponibles en un determinado lugar, su obtenci\'on por los individuos, y las estrategias tecnol\'ogicas adoptadas para su explotaci\'on. De acuerdo con este modelo, los muy trabajados bifaces ovales con filo continuo fueron producidos preferentemente en zonas con materias primas de tama\~no y resistencia suficientes para permitir frecuentes procesos de retoque, normalmente cuando el material se obten\'ia de yacimientos primarios de s\'ilex. Colecciones caracterizadas por ejemplares de forma puntiaguda con filos parciales y escasos retoques, s\'olo fueron producidas cuando los n\'ucleos utilizados eran m\'as peque\~nos y estrechos, lo que impuso limitaciones a la acci\'on tecnol\'ogica humana en cuanto a la situaci\'on y extensi\'on de las superficies a trabajar. Cuando se utilizaban, tales n\'ucleos proced\'ian normalmente de fuentes secundarias de s\'ilex, como, por ejemplo, de dep\'ositos fluviales. As\'i pues, las ``tradiciones'' puntiaguda y ovalada de Roe, no son vistas como productos de distintas poblaciones fabricantes de bifaces, sino de m\'as o menos las mismas poblaciones, haciendo frente a las exigencias de un medio ambiente hetereog\'eneo y usando distintos recursos de un modo adaptativo y flexible.},

However, gunflints were a necessary component of flintlock firearms that were obtained by most nations from a few European centers. Although most of the flints in the Nepalese armory are clearly of British origin, and some are French, a relatively small number of anomalous form and different material are probably of native manufacture, previously undocumented. Variation in quality also suggests multiple sources, some of which may have been black market or irregular.

We found that both taphonomic and behavioral processes influenced edge damage formation on the KP1 points, and the KP1 edge damage distribution is best explained by a combination of taphonomic effects and use as spear tips. The edge damage distribution method employed here advances studies of Stone Age weaponry because it can be used to quantitatively assess the effect of taphonomic and behavioral processes on stone tips without relying on subjective evaluations that attribute causation to individual wear features.},

The MSA toolmakers used a greater variety of prepared core methods and more intensively exploited cryptocrystalline and microcrystalline nodules, the scarcity of which may have resulted in a more ``formalized'' application of the Levallois Volumetric Concept.

  abstract = {It is widely agreed that biomechanical stresses imposed by stone tool behaviors influenced the evolution of the human hand. Though archaeological evidence suggests that early hominins participated in a variety of tool behaviors, it is unlikely that all behaviors equally influenced modern human hand anatomy. It is more probable that a behavior's likelihood of exerting a selective pressure was a weighted function of the magnitude of stresses associated with that behavior, the benefits received from it, and the amount of time spent performing it. Based on this premise, we focused on the first part of that equation and evaluated magnitudes of stresses associated with stone tool behaviors thought to have been commonly practiced by early hominins, to determine which placed the greatest loads on the digits. Manual pressure data were gathered from 39 human subjects using a Novel Pliance\textregistered{} manual pressure system while they participated in multiple Plio-Pleistocene tool behaviors: nut-cracking, marrow acquisition with a hammerstone, flake production with a hammerstone, and handaxe and flake use. Manual pressure distributions varied significantly according to behavior, though there was a tendency for regions of the hand subject to the lowest pressures (e.g., proximal phalanges) to be affected less by behavior type. Hammerstone use during marrow acquisition and flake production consistently placed the greatest loads on the digits collectively, on each digit and on each phalanx. Our results suggest that, based solely on the magnitudes of stresses, hammerstone use during marrow acquisition and flake production are the most likely of the assessed behaviors to have influenced the anatomical and functional evolution of the human hand.},

  abstract = {Multiple hominin species used and produced stone tools, and the archaeological record provides evidence that stone tool behaviors intensified among later members of the genus Homo. This intensification is widely thought to be the product of cognitive and anatomical adaptations that enabled later Homo taxa to produce stone tools more efficiently relative to earlier hominin species. This study builds upon recent investigations of the knapping motions of modern humans to test whether aspects of our upper limb anatomy contribute to accuracy and/or efficiency. Knapping kinematics were captured from eight experienced knappers using a Vicon motion capture system. Each subject produced a series of Oldowan bifacial choppers under two conditions: with normal wrist mobility and while wearing a brace that reduced wrist extension (w30 e35 ), simulating one aspect of the likely primitive hominin condition. Under normal conditions, subjects employed a variant of the proximal-to-distal joint sequence common to throwing activities: subjects initiated down-swing upper limb motion at the shoulder and proceeded distally, increasing peak linear and angular velocities from the shoulder to the elbow to the wrist. At the wrist, subjects utilized the `dart-thrower's arc,' the most stable plane of radiocarpal motion, during which wrist extension is coupled with radial deviation and flexion with ulnar deviation. With an unrestrained wrist, subjects achieved significantly greater target accuracy, wrist angular velocities, and hand linear velocities compared with the braced condition. Additionally, the modern wrist's ability to reach high degrees of extension (!28.5 ) following strike may decrease risk of carpal and ligamentous damage caused by hyperextension. These results suggest that wrist extension in humans contributes significantly to stone tool-making performance.},

  abstract = {Fossil, genetic and archaeological data all confirm an African origin for our own species, Homo sapiens, during the Middle Stone Age (MSA) around 200,000 years ago. Somewhere around 40,000 to 50,000 years ago, descendants of these first modern people dispersed out of Africa and ultimately colonized the entire world. This parallels the beginning of the Later Stone Age (LSA) where microlithic stone tool assemblages replace the flake tools and points of the MSA. New research in the Iringa Region in the Southern Highlands of Tanzania may offer a way to study the MSA and how it changed to the LSA. Three seasons of survey and excavation (in 2006, 2008 and 2010) have demonstrated that Iringa might contain a more or less continuous archaeological record from the late Acheulean around 500,000 years ago to the present. It thus offers a new opportunity to trace the evolution of the technology and behaviour of modern humans both prior to, and after, the Out of Africa 2 dispersal. Excavations have uncovered MSA occupation layers in three areas at one rockshelter, Magubike. LSA occupations are stratified above them in two of these areas. At a second rockshelter, Mlambalasi, there is a modern human skeleton, in a Pleistocene LSA context. This paper reviews this new evidence and what it might state about questions of modern human origins and dispersals.},

  abstract = {Fossil, genetic and archaeological data all confirm an African origin for our own species, Homo sapiens, during the Middle Stone Age (MSA) around 200,000 years ago. Somewhere around 40,000 to 50,000 years ago, descendants of these first modern people dispersed out of Africa and ultimately colonized the entire world. This parallels the beginning of the Later Stone Age (LSA) where microlithic stone tool assemblages replace the flake tools and points of the MSA. New research in the Iringa Region in the Southern Highlands of Tanzania may offer a way to study the MSA and how it changed to the LSA.

  abstract = {The excavation and analysis of Paleo-Indian artifacts from the Lindenmeier site in northern Colorado are described in detail. The site was excavated from 1934 to 1940 by Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr.; the history of these excavations is summarized. Roberts died in 1966 without completing an analysis of the excavated materials. In the same year, Wilmsen began work on the collection. The goals and strategies of the original work, as well as methods employed in the field, are reconstructed to the extent permitted by existing archival materials and publications. A detailed discussion of the physiographic features of the site location and of its Recent geologic history is presented. It is suggested that common stream meander processes are responsible for the present appearance of the site and that appeals to climatic change are unnecessary. The floral and faunal composition of the area at the time of Folsom occupation is considered in terms of preserved samples of soil, charcoal, resin, and pollen, along with molluskan and mammalian remains. A new radiocarbon age is reported and compared with an age reported previously by Haynes and Agogino (1960). These two ages are compared according to the method proposed by Long and Rippiteau (1974) and found to be indistinguishable statistically.{$<$}br/{$>$}The bulk of the report is devoted to an analysis of the stone artifacts in the collection. A method for assessing the comparability of measurements of artifacts made by different observers is introduced. This method also yields a basis for estimating the accuracy of observations and for rejecting a statistical result obtained from these observations. The artifacts are analyzed both in terms of sets of technological and functional variables and of their spatial clustering. Technologically, the artifacts are found to conform to the predictions of the wave model proposed by Speth (1972). Five major categories are defined in terms of functional variables. The spatially discrete sets of artifacts are found to be identical technologically and to possess only minor functional differences. These clusters are interpreted to be the debris remains of camps occupied periodically by socially and economically interacting units. Stylistic variation among projectile points is found to be highly significant and spatially discrete. These findings are used to support a hypothesis of social segmentation among the early inhabitants of the site.},

The EdPk-3 cores were in surface association with artifacts primarily belonging to the Cody Complex.

The lithology is represented mainly by clayey or laminated layers. A catastrophic event, which is marked by very coarse deposits, occurred probably between ca 1070\textendash 960~cal yr B.P. and possibly is associated with an unusually severe La Ni\~na event. Before and after this event, a similar combination of the two main sediment types is recorded. The repeated alternation of laminated and clayey layers is interpreted as the response to local hydrologic forcing, which may reflect a shift from relatively wet to relatively drier conditions, respectively. Variable amount of micro-charcoal is detected all along the profile. Without additional evidence, notwithstanding the initial local human settlement documented since ca 2900 14C yr B.P., micro-charcoal occurrence and variability cannot be linked directly to an anthropogenic origin. No distinct palynological zonations in relation to the lithology are observed, and the vegetation changes may only represent minor transitions across environmental limits.},

Two hypptheses to explain their presence and time depth there have been proposed. The migration hypothesis brings them from the southern Sierra Nevadas across the Great Basin beginning no earlier than A.D. 1000. The in situ hypothesis argues for a residency of 5000 to 7000 year\textasciitilde.. The hypotheses are tested by drawing pred\textasciitilde ct1ons\_ from them. Using ceramics, rock art, strat1graph1c sequences, and adaptive data the in situ hypothesis may be falsified. The migration hypothesis then best explains the archaeological evidence. It is thus suggested that Shoshonean speakers did not reach southern Wyoming until the fifteenth century A.D. at the earliest. It is also suggested that the higher mountainous areas of Jackson Hole and Yellowstone Park were not occupied by the Shoshonean speakers until after they were driven from \textasciitilde he northwestern Plains around A.D. 1800{$\cdot$}. Finally, it 1s proposed, but not tested, that Athapaskan speakers may have occupied the region of western Wyoming from the Altithermal until the time of the Shoshonean and Crow migrations of the fifteenth century.

Data from the earliest phase of the SAS member, comprising the basal SASU and SASL sub-members from caves 1 and 1A are discussed. A new U-Th date of 126.0 {$\pm$} 1.5 ka on flowstone associated with fallen tufa material within the base of the SASU sub-member provides a maximum age for this part of the sequence. The lowermost SASU sub-member formed most likely around 100 000 years ago during a period associated with increased precipitation whereas the age of the underlying SASL sub-member is uncertain. The SASU sub-member contains in situ deposits that include hearths, in contrast to the underlying SASL sub-member that was subject to post depositional disturbance. Despite the different site formation processes the lithic industry of both sub-members is similar although quartz utilization is somewhat more prominent in the SASL sub-member. The main reduction strategy involves a parallel unidirectional convergent method to produce quartzite blade and point blanks with rare retouch. Relatively more browsing fauna and riparian species, indicating more closed environments, occur in the SASU layers. The older SASL sub-member, not previously described as an independent unit, contains relatively more grazers suggesting drier and more open habitats. It is vital to link evidence from coastal sites such as Klasies River to data from the interior to promote insight into modern human origins from a wider landscape perspective. The work of James Brink, to whom this paper is dedicated, is invaluable in developing this connection.},

It is unnecessary to invoke a unique-for-mammals genetic mechanism to explain the handaxe phenomenon. Instead, we propose that two nongenetic processes are sufficient. The first is a set of ergonomic design principles linked to the production of sturdy, hand-held cutting tools in the context of a knapped-stone technology that lacked hafting. The second is an esthetic preference for regular forms with gradual curves and pleasing proportions. Neither process is a cultural meme but, operating together in a cultural context, they can account for all of the supposedly puzzling timespace patterns presented by handaxes.},

One important component of modern thinking is expertise, exemplified best in expert performances in the arts, craft production, sport, medicine, and games such as chess. Expertise is driven by a cognitive system known as long-term working memory, in which retrieval structures held in long-term memory are activated in working memory. Here they enable rapid access to large bodies of procedural and declarative knowledge that have been acquired over years of practice. Although expertise underpins many of our most esteemed accomplishments, it is not reliant on either symbols or language. In the following essay we analyze one example of prehistoric expertise\textemdash Marjorie's core from Maastricht-Belvedere. From Nathan Schlanger's (1996) description of the cha\^ine op\'eratoire we have been able to identify many of the elements of the retrieval structure activated for knapping the core. In its overall organization this retrieval structure was no different from those deployed by modern artisans. With this analysis in hand we are then able to contrast this Levallois retrieval structure with one required for an earlier biface fa\c{c}onnage reduction, thereby tracing one link in the evolutionary sequence leading ultimately to modern expertise.},

For its estimated age-at-death (6.5 years), its state of dental development is comparable to that of equivalently aged modern children. These findings suggest that several facets of modern human dental growth and development evolved in East Asia before the appearance of fully modern human morphology.},

Each stage is associated with particular rates of physical growth (e.g., height [cm/year]), characteristics of dentition, changes related to methods of feeding, physical and mental competencies, and maturation of the reproductive system and sexual behavior. An extended period from juvenility through adolescence that separates infancy from adulthood is unique to humans; the life histories of other mammals, including other primates, have a comparatively brief transition into physical and cognitive maturity. Extended adolescence in humans is argued to have evolved to accommodate our greater brain growth, which together affords the ability to acquire the accumulated cultural knowledge and social skills necessary for success as a mature adult. In this article, I propose that there may have been key differences in the life history characteristics of Neanderthals and H. sapiens, with Neanderthals experiencing comparatively short juvenile and adolescent stages of development. Neanderthals would consequently have been at a disadvantage in terms of their learning capacity, contributing to their eventual replacement by H. sapiens.},

XCL dates to ca. 1.36 Ma, making it one of the earliest sites in Northeast Asia. Although XCL represents the first excavation of an Early Pleistocene site in the Nihewan Basin, identified and excavated in the 1970's, the lithic assemblages have never been published in full detail. Here we describe the lithic assemblages from XCL, providing information on stone tool reduction techniques and the influence of raw materials on artefact manufacture. The XCL hominins used both bipolar and freehand reduction techniques to manufacture small flakes, some of which show retouch. Bipolar reduction methods at XCL were used more frequently than previously recognized. Comparison of XCL with other Early Pleistocene sites in the Nihewan Basin indicates the variable use of bipolar and freehand reduction methods, thereby indicating a flexible approach in the utilization of raw materials. The stone tools from XCL and the Nihewan sites are classifiable as Mode I lithic assemblages, readily distinguished from bifacial industries manufactured by hominins in Eastern Asia by ca. 800 ka.},

Nevertheless, visual observations of the assemblage from Yiftahel supplemented by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) tests show that heat treatment was carried out during the later stages of reduction sequence, mainly on blade blanks, before their transformation into tools. Careful and intentional annealing of this type of blank probably allowed better control over the heat treatment process and more successful propagation of pressure retouch during the final stages of tool modification. In some cases, heat treatment also affected the color of the item, perhaps increasing its visual attractiveness. The smooth and aesthetic appearance of pressure retouch on the one hand and the appearance of ``eye-catching colors'' of the blanks on the other, perhaps increased the economic value of finished tools and influenced their spread within local exchange trade networks and perhaps beyond.},

While one Aduma site may, on the basis of lithic comparison, be assigned to an early phase of the MSA, both absolute dates and lithic typology indicate that the remainder represent a significantly later stage of this industrial tradition, likely dating to ca. 80,000 to 100,000 years ago. Assemblages were deposited on an aggrading alluvially dominated landscape which included riverine and floodplain environments. Chronological changes in landform and raw material availability within the geographically limited Aduma region provided a dynamic context that required behavioral flexibility to adapt successfully. Analysis of ten assemblages from eight sites provides the basis for characterizing the Aduma sequence, setting it into broader sub-Saharan context and reconstructing aspects of hominid subsistence strategy and lithic economy.},

Albeit the lack of clear architectural structures, the abundant finds demonstrate a wide variety of activities held at this locale, including faunai and floral resource processing and consumption, on-site lithic production and large-scale pyrotechnological activities. A complex secondary burial of two individuals accompanied with what might be interpreted as grave goods ( mainly ground stones ) indicates more complex, socio-cultural activities as well. As the Neolithic period represents an important departure from Palaeolithic life-ways and the movement toward new economical and social spheres, it is important to bridge the gaps in our current knowledge of the spatial and temporal trends in settlement patterns associated with it. Our aim is thus to attempt a reconstruction of the function ofBir el-Maksur and place it within the larger framework of the PPNA. In this respect, and although hindered by post depositional processes as well as by the restricted extent of the studied area, these excavations illustrate important new data concerning the occupation of the Lower Galilee during this important period.},

  abstract = {Space use in Middle Paleolithic (MP) camps has been suggested as a source of information on the intensity and repetition of occupations and, by extension, of demographics. In the Levant, clear evidence for differential intrasite use and maintenance was important in viewing the late MP Neanderthal sites as base camps inhabited for a significant duration, relative to the Early MP (EMP). We test this model with the rich faunal assemblage from the EMP ({$>$}140 ka) site of Misliya Cave, Mount Carmel, Israel. Excavations in Misliya yielded a large and diverse lithic assemblage, combustion features, and a modern human maxilla, together with a large archaeofaunal assemblage that we use as a spatial marker. We analyzed the distribution of bone items with variable taphonomic properties (anthropogenic, biogenic, and abiotic bone-surface modifications) in a hearth-related context, both by comparing grid squares and point patterns. Both analyses are largely congruent. They indicate repeated and consistent use of the site's space that includes hearth-related consumption activities and peripheral activities further away, albeit with little evidence for site maintenance. Thus, the Misliya results display a mixed signal of clear around-the-fire pattern and differential space use in the EMP that is reminiscent of the much later MP sites in the Levant, but without the more elaborate camp maintenance. More case studies and detailed proxies are needed before we can fine-tune our understanding of camp structure in the Levantine MP and its bearing to site occupation dynamics.},

During the last decade, new data and new perspectives continuously suggested the IHRA handaxe is quite younger than previously expected and are not coeval with Acheulian handaxes; this furnished with an excellent opportunity to re-examine the technological characteristics of palaeolithic assemblages in this area. Critically examining the result of past research as well as reviewing available chronometric dates, the IHRA handaxe is claimed to be far from the result of Acheulian acculturation during the Middle Pleistocene in the Far Eastern Asia. It was initially made considerably later than the termination of volcanic eruption; many chronometric dates indicate that the IHRA handaxe found above the basalt bed was made no earlier than MIS 4 and persisted until the end of MIS 3. This temporal range does not support that the IHRA handaxe is coeval and an out of Acheulian influence. An alternative position to this culture-oriented perspective is that the emergence of IHRA handaxe is engineered not solely by hominin migration or transmission of manufacturing ideas, but can be brought about by other human interference (e.g. reflecting the genetic flows in the course of micro-evolution among local hominin groups). A claim of independent emergence of Acheulian-like handaxe in the Far East area can open a venue to a more realistic idea that the materialistic expression of Pleistocene Old World is rather stochastic than axiomatic regardless of culture-based transmission of specific ideas.},

  abstract = {Spatiotemporal proximity analysis to determine spatiotemporal proximal paths is a critical step for many movement analysis methods. However, few effective methods have been developed in the literature for spatiotemporal proximity analysis of movement data. Therefore, this study proposes a space-time-integrated approach for spatiotemporal proximal analysis considering space and time dimensions simultaneously. The proposed approach is based on space-time buffering, which is a natural extension of conventional spatial buffering operation to space and time dimensions. Given a space-time path and spatial tolerance, space-time buffering constructs a space-time region by continuously generating spatial buffers for any location along the space-time path. The constructed space-time region can delimit all space-time locations whose spatial distances to the target trajectory are less than a given tolerance. Five space-time overlapping operations based on this space-time buffering are proposed to retrieve all spatiotemporal proximal trajectories to the target spacetime path, in terms of different spatiotemporal proximity metrics of space-time paths, such as Fr\'echet distance and longest common subsequence. The proposed approach is extended to analyze space-time paths constrained in road networks. The compressed linear reference technique is adopted to implement the proposed approach for spatiotemporal proximity analysis in large movement datasets. A case study using real-world movement data verifies that the proposed approach can efficiently retrieve spatiotemporal proximal paths constrained in road networks from a large movement database, and has significant computational advantage over conventional space-time separated approaches.},

  abstract = {The evolutionary reasons for variation in nose shape across human populations have been subject to continuing debate. An import function of the nose and nasal cavity is to condition inspired air before it reaches the lower respiratory tract. For this reason, it is thought the observed differences in nose shape among populations are not simply the result of genetic drift, but may be adaptations to climate. To address the question of whether local adaptation to climate is responsible for nose shape divergence across populations, we use Qst\textendash Fst comparisons to show that nares width and alar base width are more differentiated across populations than expected under genetic drift alone. To test whether this differentiation is due to climate adaptation, we compared the spatial distribution of these variables with the global distribution of temperature, absolute humidity, and relative humidity. We find that width of the nares is correlated with temperature and absolute humidity, but not with relative humidity. We conclude that some aspects of nose shape may indeed have been driven by local adaptation to climate. However, we think that this is a simplified explanation of a very complex evolutionary history, which possibly also involved other non-neutral forces such as sexual selection., The study of human adaptation is essential to our understanding of disease etiology. Evolutionary investigations into why certain disease phenotypes such as sickle-cell anemia and lactose intolerance occur at different rates in different populations have led to a better understanding of the genetic and environmental risk factors involved. Similarly, research into the geographical distribution of skin pigmentation continues to yield important clues regarding risk of vitamin D deficiency and skin cancer. Here, we investigate whether variation in the shape of the external nose across populations has been driven by regional differences in climate. We find that variation in both nares width and alar base width appear to have experienced accelerated divergence across human populations. We also find that the geospatial distribution of nares width is correlated with temperature, and absolute humidity, but not with relative humidity. Our results support the claim that local adaptation to climate may have had a role in the evolution of nose shape differences across human populations.},

  abstract = {The Early Middle Palaeolithic (EMP) industries in the Levant (ca 250-160 ka ago) are distinguished by the presence of true laminar technology, alongside Levallois recurrent unidirectional and bidirectional flaking methods. The EMP further differs from the later MP in the composition of the toolkit. It was previously suggested that EMP retouched tool assemblages are characterised by the presence of elongated Mousterian points made on blades, retouched blades and Upper Palaeolithic (UP) tool-types. In contrast, the later MP is characterised by diverse toolkits dominated by side-scrapers, denticulates and UP types and containing only very few retouched points. However, while numerous later MP sites have been subjected to quantitative technological and typological studies, such studies are rare for EMP assemblages. This paper focuses on typological aspects of the EMP assemblage of Misliya Cave, Mount Carmel, Israel, in an attempt to characterise the site toolkit and to assess the differences between the EMP and later MP toolkits. The study demonstrates that the most characteristic features of the Misliya Cave toolkit are: high proportion of elongated retouched points; production of different types of points; preference for blades as blanks for tool production; use of different types of retouch for the preparation of different tool types. Our results show that toolkit-composition at Misliya and other EMP sites in the Levant is considerably different from later MP toolkits. We hypothesise that the different toolkits mark a shift in the range of activities or in the way similar activities were carried out in the EMP and later MP.},

  abstract = {A Bayesian framework is developed to detect multiple abrupt shifts in a time series of the annual major hurricanes counts. The hurricane counts are modeled by a Poisson process where the Poisson intensity (i.e., hurricane rate) is codified by a gamma distribution. Here, a triple hypothesis space concerning the annual hurricane rate is considered: ``a no change in the rate,'' ``a single change in the rate,'' and ``a double change in the rate.'' A hierarchical Bayesian approach involving three layers\textemdash data, parameter, and hypothesis\textemdash is formulated to demonstrate the posterior probability of each possible hypothesis and its relevant model parameters through a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. Based on sampling from an estimated informative prior for the Poisson rate parameters and the posterior distribution of hypotheses, two simulated examples are illustrated to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. Subsequently, the methodology is applied to the time series of major hurricane counts over the eastern North Pacific (ENP). Results indicate that the hurricane activity over ENP has very likely undergone a decadal variation with two changepoints occurring around 1982 and 1999 with three epochs characterized by the inactive 1972\textendash 81 epoch, the active 1982\textendash 98 epoch, and the inactive 1999\textendash 2003 epoch. The Bayesian method also provides a means for predicting decadal major hurricane variations. A lower number of major hurricanes are predicted for the next decade given the recent inactive period of hurricane activity.},

  abstract = {The existence of ice in ice-covered waters may cause damage to the propeller of polar ships, especially when massive ice floes are submerged around the hull. This paper aims to simulate an interaction process of a direct ice collision with a propeller based on the cohesive element method. A constitutive law is applied to model the ice material. The model of ice material is validated against model test results. The resulting impact loads acting on the contact surfaces and the corresponding ice block velocity are calculated in the time domain. The ice crushing, shearing and fracture failures are reproduced in the simulation. The convergence study with three meshing sizes of ice block is performed. To carry out a parametric study, five parameters are selected for analysis. These parameters are composed of rotational speed, direction of the propeller, initial speed of the ice block, contact position, and area between the ice and the propeller. The results show that the ice loads are affected by the five factors significantly. Ice loads tend to increase by decreasing the rotational speed, increasing the initial ice speed and the contact area, and changing the rotational direction from clockwise to counterclockwise. The effect of the contact position on the impact loads is relatively complex, depending on rotational speeds of the propeller.},

  abstract = {The late persistence in Southern Iberia of a Neandertal-associated Middle Paleolithic is supported by the archeological stratigraphy and the radiocarbon and luminescence dating of three newly excavated localities in the Mula basin of Murcia (Spain). At Cueva Ant\'on, Mousterian layer I-k can be no more than 37,100 years-old. At La Boja, the basal Aurignacian can be no less than 36,500 years-old. The regional Middle-to-Upper Paleolithic transition process is thereby bounded to the first half of the 37th millennium Before Present, in agreement with evidence from Andalusia, Gibraltar and Portugal. This chronology represents a lag of minimally 3000 years with the rest of Europe, where that transition and the associated process of Neandertal/modern human admixture took place between 40,000 and 42,000 years ago. The lag implies the presence of an effective barrier to migration and diffusion across the Ebro river depression, which, based on available paleoenvironmental indicators, would at that time have represented a major biogeographical divide. In addition, (a) the Phlegraean Fields caldera explosion, which occurred 39,850 years ago, would have stalled the Neandertal/modern human admixture front because of the population sink it generated in Central and Eastern Europe, and (b) the long period of ameliorated climate that came soon after (Greenland Interstadial 8, during which forests underwent a marked expansion in Iberian regions south of 40\textdegree N) would have enhanced the ``Ebro Frontier'' effect. These findings have two broader paleoanthropological implications: firstly, that, below the Ebro, the archeological record made prior to 37,000 years ago must be attributed, in all its aspects and components, to the Neandertals (or their ancestors); secondly, that modern human emergence is best seen as an uneven, punctuated process during which long-lasting barriers to gene flow and cultural diffusion could have existed across rather short distances, with attendant consequences for ancient genetics and models of human population history.},

  abstract = {Technological artefacts and biological organisms 'evolve' by very similar processes of blind variation and selective retention. This analogy is explored systematically, for the first time, by a team of international experts from evolutionary biology, history and sociology of science and technology, cognitive and computer science, economics, psychology, education, cultural anthropology and research management. Do technological 'memes' play the role of genes? In what sense are novel inventions 'blind'? Does the element of design make them 'Lamarckian' rather than 'Darwinian'? Is the recombination of ideas the essence of technological creativity? Can invention be simulated computationally? What are the entities that actually evolve - artefacts, ideas or organisations? These are only some of the many questions stimulated and partially answered by this powerful metaphor. With its practical demonstration of the explanatory potential of 'evolutionary reasoning' in a well-defined context, this book is a ground-breaking contribution to every discipline concerned with cultural change.},

The burin-core technology is integrated into the general knapping strategy using byproducts from the large blade production as core blanks.
